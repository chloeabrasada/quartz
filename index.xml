From a YT Comment
Step 1. Laser focus on what you want and only what you want. Don&amp;rsquo;t talk yourself or allow yourself to be talked out of your desire. Write it down. Don&amp;rsquo;t let yourself get distracted. Step 2. Question what you consciously and unconsciously believe about your desire.</description></item><item><title>Human Resources MOC</title><link>https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/moc/hr/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/moc/hr/</guid><description/></item><item><title>In progress</title><link>https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/notes/por/in-progress/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/notes/por/in-progress/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Leadership MOC</title><link>https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/moc/leadership/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/moc/leadership/</guid><description> Positive Leadership</description></item><item><title>Learning MOC</title><link>https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/moc/learning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/moc/learning/</guid><description> Where to Learn What to Learn</description></item><item><title>Life Advice MOC</title><link>https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/moc/lifeadvice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/moc/lifeadvice/</guid><description> What to answer to mamamatay din tayong lahat 3 steps to change your life</description></item><item><title>Mental Health MOC</title><link>https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/moc/mh/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/moc/mh/</guid><description>Self-awareness Personality Tests</description></item><item><title>Mental Models MOC</title><link>https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/moc/mental-models/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/moc/mental-models/</guid><description> Unsorted

It’s easy for us to think that we’re too selfish, but in fact, most of us aren’t anywhere near selfish enough. We’re not used to putting our own needs, wants, desires centre stage because we’re ‘good’ people. How?

While I do admit that I sometimes say &amp;ldquo;Mamamatay din tayong lahat&amp;rdquo; in an escapist manner (albeit true), I do acknowledge that it is true, comforting, and a good way to move forward when it comes to handling problems. However, this acceptance into the finite nature of life also makes one prone to not living ceasing each day.
Embracing stoicism is a good way to avoid that mistake.</description></item><item><title>What to Learn</title><link>https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/notes/perdev/learning/what-to-learn/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/notes/perdev/learning/what-to-learn/</guid><description> Tags: Relevant Notes: Learning Where to Learn Thoughts: Sources What skills do you recommend I pick up via online courses? - #DearTBC</description></item><item><title>Where to Learn</title><link>https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/notes/perdev/learning/where-to-learn/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/notes/perdev/learning/where-to-learn/</guid><description> Tags: in-progress Relevant Notes: Learning What to Learn Thoughts: General Courses Skillshare Coursera LinkedIn Learning Udemy FutureLearn Design x Tech Events General Assembly The Gynasium Courses FreeCodeCamp Hyperlink Business GoTo Stage Languages Memrise</description></item><item><title>Writing</title><link>https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/moc/writing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/moc/writing/</guid><description> Emptyy!!
