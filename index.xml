I think it&amp;rsquo;s a wonderful philosophy that all in all makes life easier. Here are some of my unstoic notes as I was learning about stoicism and continue to build it on today.
Note also that I forgot to list down my resources on everything compiled here (since I had them on early this year)! üòû I&amp;rsquo;m trying to look for them now!</description></item><item><title>What to answer to 'mamamatay rin tayong lahat'</title><link>chloe-garden.live/moc/perdev/mamamatay/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>chloe-garden.live/moc/perdev/mamamatay/</guid><description>This may seem.. morbid. While I do admit that I sometimes say &amp;ldquo;Mamamatay din tayong lahat&amp;rdquo; in an escapist manner (albeit true), I do acknowledge that it is true, comforting, and a good way to move forward when it comes to handling problems. However, this acceptance into the finite nature of life also makes one prone to not living ceasing each day.
Embracing stoicism is a good way to avoid that mistake.</description></item><item><title>writing</title><link>chloe-garden.live/moc/writing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>chloe-garden.live/moc/writing/</guid><description>Writing Projects Interplays of Mathematics and Classism</description></item></channel></rss>
