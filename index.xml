‚≠êÔ∏è Hello! I&amp;rsquo;m Chloe. Welcome to my working file of Interplays of Mathematics and Classism . This file contains my thought processes involved in writing my capstone divided into three phases‚Äìpre-writing, rough writing, and actual writing (okay, I honestly don&amp;rsquo;t know if there are more technicalities on this).
üí≠ I&amp;rsquo;m an intuitive thinker, so you can find that most of the notes here are scattered and out of place, but in a sense&amp;hellip; organized.</description></item><item><title>Learning</title><link>chloe-garden.live/moc/perdev/learning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>chloe-garden.live/moc/perdev/learning/</guid><description> Add details on learning how to learn!</description></item><item><title>Life Advice</title><link>chloe-garden.live/moc/perdev/lifeadvice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>chloe-garden.live/moc/perdev/lifeadvice/</guid><description>Contents What to answer to mamamatay din tayong lahat</description></item><item><title>Stoicism</title><link>chloe-garden.live/moc/philosophy/stoicism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>chloe-garden.live/moc/philosophy/stoicism/</guid><description>Tags: #philosophy #in-progress Related to:
Memento mori Early 2021, I journeyed on to integrating stoicism to my life. I think it&amp;rsquo;s a wonderful philosophy that all in all makes life easier. Here are some of my unstoic notes as I was learning about stoicism and continue to build it on today.
Note also that I forgot to list down my resources on everything compiled here (since I had them on early this year)!</description></item><item><title>What to answer to 'mamamatay din tayong lahat'</title><link>chloe-garden.live/moc/perdev/mamamatay/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>chloe-garden.live/moc/perdev/mamamatay/</guid><description>This may seem.. morbid. While I do admit that I sometimes say &amp;ldquo;Mamamatay din tayong lahat&amp;rdquo; in an escapist manner (albeit true), I do acknowledge that it is true, comforting, and a good way to move forward when it comes to handling problems. However, this acceptance into the finite nature of life also makes one prone to not living ceasing each day.
Embracing stoicism is a good way to avoid that mistake.</description></item><item><title>writing</title><link>chloe-garden.live/moc/writing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>chloe-garden.live/moc/writing/</guid><description>Writing Projects Interplays of Mathematics and Classism</description></item></channel></rss>
