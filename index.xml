No to micromanaging Becoming better I really value the importance of giving feedback. Our words are too powerful to impart things callously. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen people give feedback differently, and I think there&amp;rsquo;s no super perfect formula into giving it because people are so unpredictable and subjective.
