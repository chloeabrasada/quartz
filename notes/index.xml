In the circular economy, resources would be continually re-used, meaning that there would be no more mining activity or waste production. The stress is on recycling, made possible by designing products so that they can easily be taken apart.

No to micromanaging life-advice I really value the importance of giving feedback. Our words are too powerful to impart things callously. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen people give feedback differently, and I think there&amp;rsquo;s no super perfect formula into giving it because people are so unpredictable and subjective.

Step 1. Laser focus on what you want and only what you want. Don&amp;rsquo;t talk yourself or allow yourself to be talked out of your desire. Write it down. Don&amp;rsquo;t let yourself get distracted. Step 2. Question what you consciously and unconsciously believe about your desire.
