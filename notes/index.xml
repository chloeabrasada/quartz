From a YT Comment
Step 1. Laser focus on what you want and only what you want. Don&amp;rsquo;t talk yourself or allow yourself to be talked out of your desire. Write it down. Don&amp;rsquo;t let yourself get distracted. Step 2. Question what you consciously and unconsciously believe about your desire.</description></item><item><title>In progress</title><link>https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/notes/por/in-progress/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/notes/por/in-progress/</guid><description/></item><item><title>On Digital Gardens</title><link>https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/notes/home/garden/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/notes/home/garden/</guid><description>This digital garden is one of my personal projects this year! I&amp;rsquo;m still learning if there&amp;rsquo;s a proper way of setting it up.
I realized how unconducive for permanence my past notes were. I literally have too much bookmark managers + mind dumps (thanks Apple Notes, Telegram, Messenger, Mem.ai for keeping up with me).
What&amp;rsquo;s a digital garden? A digital garden is an online space at the intersection of a notebook and a blog, where digital gardeners share seeds of thoughts to be cultivated in public.</description></item><item><title>Personality Tests</title><link>https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/notes/perdev/mh/self-awareness/tests/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/notes/perdev/mh/self-awareness/tests/</guid><description>Tags: Relevant Notes: Self-awareness Thoughts: Tests My results are here lol. 👻
Enneagram I like the enneagram test because there are a looot of resources about working with enneagram styles as well as the performance of each personality depending on their health level.

It’s easy for us to think that we’re too selfish, but in fact, most of us aren’t anywhere near selfish enough. We’re not used to putting our own needs, wants, desires centre stage because we’re ‘good’ people. How? Cases Instead of asking “what do you do?“, a more standard question when meeting someone should be “In what ways are you weird?</description></item><item><title>What to answer to 'mamamatay rin tayong lahat'</title><link>https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/notes/perdev/life-advice/mamamatay/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/notes/perdev/life-advice/mamamatay/</guid><description>This may seem.. morbid. While I do admit that I sometimes say &amp;ldquo;Mamamatay din tayong lahat&amp;rdquo; in an escapist manner (albeit true), I do acknowledge that it is true, comforting, and a good way to move forward when it comes to handling problems. However, this acceptance into the finite nature of life also makes one prone to not living ceasing each day.
