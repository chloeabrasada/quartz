I&amp;rsquo;m still learning if there&amp;rsquo;s a proper way of setting it up.
I realized how unconducive for permanence my past notes were. I literally have too much bookmark managers + mind dumps (thanks Apple Notes, Telegram, Messenger, Mem.ai for keeping up with me).
What&amp;rsquo;s a digital garden? A digital garden is an online space at the intersection of a notebook and a blog, where digital gardeners share seeds of thoughts to be cultivated in public.</description></item><item><title>Quotes on Stoicism</title><link>garden.chloeabrasada.online/notes/philosophy/stoicism/stoic-quotes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>garden.chloeabrasada.online/notes/philosophy/stoicism/stoic-quotes/</guid><description>References Source: Keywords: permanent notes Tags: #stoicism Relevant Notes: Thoughts: Quotes “We are often more frightened than hurt; and we suffer more from imagination than from reality.” — Seneca “It’s silly to try to escape other people’s faults.
