I&amp;rsquo;m Chloe Abrasada. I actually have a second name that I don&amp;rsquo;t use for branding purposes (jkjk). I&amp;rsquo;m a productivity nerd 👩‍🏫, web lurker 💻, and design enthusiast 🎨.
📚 I&amp;rsquo;m currently an incoming third year student in UP Manila studying Occupational Therapy. Outside school, I part time as a designer and volunteer in NGOs related to my cause. 🍃

I&amp;rsquo;m still learning if there&amp;rsquo;s a proper way of setting it up.
I realized how unconducive for permanence my past notes were. I literally have too much bookmark managers + mind dumps (thanks Apple Notes, Telegram, Messenger, Mem.ai for keeping up with me).
What&amp;rsquo;s a digital garden? A digital garden is an online space at the intersection of a notebook and a blog, where digital gardeners share seeds of thoughts to be cultivated in public.</description></item><item><title>Personality Tests</title><link>garden.chloeabrasada.online/notes/perdev/mh/self-awareness/tests/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>garden.chloeabrasada.online/notes/perdev/mh/self-awareness/tests/</guid><description>Tags: Relevant Notes: Self-awareness Thoughts: Tests My results are here lol. 👻
Enneagram I like the enneagram test because there are a looot of resources about working with enneagram styles as well as the performance of each personality depending on their health level.

While I do admit that I sometimes say &amp;ldquo;Mamamatay din tayong lahat&amp;rdquo; in an escapist manner (albeit true), I do acknowledge that it is true, comforting, and a good way to move forward when it comes to handling problems. However, this acceptance into the finite nature of life also makes one prone to not living ceasing each day.
Embracing stoicism is a good way to avoid that mistake.</description></item><item><title>What to Learn</title><link>garden.chloeabrasada.online/notes/perdev/learning/what-to-learn/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>garden.chloeabrasada.online/notes/perdev/learning/what-to-learn/</guid><description> Tags: Relevant Notes: Learning Where to Learn Thoughts: Sources What skills do you recommend I pick up via online courses? - #DearTBC</description></item><item><title>Where to Learn</title><link>garden.chloeabrasada.online/notes/perdev/learning/where-to-learn/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>garden.chloeabrasada.online/notes/perdev/learning/where-to-learn/</guid><description> Tags: in-progress Relevant Notes: Learning What to Learn Thoughts: General Courses Skillshare Coursera LinkedIn Learning Udemy FutureLearn Design x Tech Events General Assembly The Gynasium Courses FreeCodeCamp Hyperlink Business GoTo Stage Languages Memrise</description></item><item><title>Writing Prompts</title><link>garden.chloeabrasada.online/notes/por/wri-prompt/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>garden.chloeabrasada.online/notes/por/wri-prompt/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
