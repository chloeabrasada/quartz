7 Cups for the Searching Soul | The 7 Cups Community &amp;ldquo;People in the advanced groups are not supposed to have problems. Sadly, this approach keeps many people in a place of quiet suffering. They feel alone in their private pain.

No to micromanaging life-advice I really value the importance of giving feedback. Our words are too powerful to impart things callously. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen people give feedback differently, and I think there&amp;rsquo;s no super perfect formula into giving it because people are so unpredictable and subjective. I adjust my approach, but what I always seek to maintain is to relay feedback in a constructive manner that helps a person move forward concretely.</description></item><item><title>How to Be Stoic</title><link>https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/notes/philosophy/stoicism/how-to/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/notes/philosophy/stoicism/how-to/</guid><description>Tags: philo Relevant Notes: What to answer to mamamatay rin tayong lahat Notes Highlights Dichotomy of Control “The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I actually control.

Step 1. Laser focus on what you want and only what you want. Don&amp;rsquo;t talk yourself or allow yourself to be talked out of your desire. Write it down.
