Chloe Abrasada! As a chronic learner, I like my life with organized chaos.. hence the ~~scattered folder under folder~~ garden. 📁\n\n💡 One of my personal goals this year is to become more intentional with my identity of loving learning. Here's me committing it into existence. 🌸\n\n🧠 In this garden/ [second brain](https://fortelabs.co/blog/basboverview/), I publish my learning notes, journeys, and projects as [evergreen notes](https://mikegiannulis.com/how-to-take-evergreen-notes/) that I continue to cultivate and grow–there is no perfect *end state*, and it will always be a work in progress! My notes range from fleeting notes to completely fleshed out permanent notes. I write more about digital gardens [here.](home/garden.md)\n\n💪  Building since July 26, 2021 and deployed on July 27, 2021.\n\n\u003e ***“When learning is purposeful, creativity blossoms.

I'm Chloe Abrasada. I actually have a second name that I don't use for branding purposes *(jkjk)*. I'm a productivity nerd 👩‍🏫, web lurker 💻, and design enthusiast 🎨.\n\n📚 I'm an incoming third year student in UP Manila studying Occupational Therapy. Outside school, I part time as a designer and volunteer in NGOs related to my cause. 🍃\n\n## 🔗 Links\n- I publish my works here at my [portfolio](https://chloeabrasada.online/) and [Behance.](https://www.behance.net/chloeabrasada)\n- Let's connect at [LinkedIn!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chloeabrasada)\n- I like writing at [Medium](https://chloeabrasada.medium.com/) and ~~am trying to gauge when I am ready to deploy my personal blog to the world~~.\n- I'm also at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/chloeabrasada/) and [Instagram.](https://www.instagram.com/chloeabrasada)\n- I like dumping my brain in [Are.na,](https://www.are.na/chloe-abrasada), inspiration-seeking in [Pinterest,](https://www.pinterest.ph/chloeabrasada), and reading long chunks of text in [Refind.](https://refind.com/chloe-abrasada)\n\n## 🍉 Luvs...\n\n🥳 I'm in love with learning, building, and creating! So I pretty much *can* get interested at anything, but here are some of the things that really pique my interest:\n\n- I like learning about health in general! I've been a health nut (I don't drink carbonated drinks lol) for a huge part of my life and have been working out consistently since the start of 2021 after *yeeeeaaaarsss* of having month-long exercise stints.\n- Mental health! I started my advocacy journey back in 2018, and it has been a huge part of who I am.\n- Productivity! I'm a tool \u0026 tip hoarder. Most of my notes are still scattered everywhere since I jump through tools and scavenge a lot of things.\n- ✨ Design ✨\n- Philosophy! I try to practice [stoicism](moc/stoicism.md) and am trying to transition into practicing it more. Since I started in 2021, I also journal daily, reflect monthly, and have an annual year-round up!\n- Psychology! One of my goals is to read this huge repository of psychology books.. but I haven't found the luxury to do so yet. 💭 I like [personality tests](notes/personality-tests.md) and [self-awareness.](notes/self-awareness.md)\n- Anything related to personal development! I'm trying to get into reading more non-fiction books this year. I recently read [Atomic Habits by James Clear](notes/sources/books/atomic-habits.md). I'm also subscribed to a loooot of [newsletters](notes/sources/newsletters.md) and make time to read them.\n- Leadership and facilitation 👥\n- Music 🎧 I have over a hundred playlists on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/chloeabrasada) and am constantly on the lookout for good finds. I'm also a bathroom singer and frustrated guitarist/ pianist. I sometimes post in [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/chloeabrasada) lol.\n- Sitcoms! When I'm too tired to do anythiiing, I like spending my time watching lighthearted shows for the sake of just smiling.\n- Dogs... 🐶\n- Tea lol. I like green tea \u0026 chai. 🍵 Also, tea \u003e coffee.",title:"About Me"},"/home/building-this-website":{content:"---\ntitle: \"Building this Website\"\nnotoc: true\n---\n\n\n\n### Oldest to latest\n- `07/26/2021` **Quartz** Set-up\n-  `07/27/2021` Site actually FINALLY up lol struggled through that\n	-  **What I didn't know before this lol**\n		-  Wikilinks don't work on Github Pages\n		-  Doesn't support spaces\n-  `07/29/2021` Fixed backlinks\n	-  **What I didn't know before this**\n		-  There was an error in my `config.toml`\n-  `07/29/2021` Change color of page\n- `07/31/2021` Add \"Let's go back\" on 404\n	- [How to make an HTML back link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8814472/how-to-make-an-html-back-link)\n- `08/01/2021` Add date late updated at footer\n	- [Last modified date of a file on a website](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1034794/last-modified-date-of-a-file-on-a-web-site)\n- `08/01/2021` Add changelog at footer\n	- Obsidian Vault changelog plug-in\n	- **What I didn't know before this**\n		- Won't really work without frontmatter\n- `08/02/2021` Add option to remove TOC\n- `08/03/2021` Add arrow to external links\n	- [Superscript in CSS only? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/501671/superscript-in-css-only/501696)\n-  `08/07/2021` Change fonts \u0026 add text-background on hover\n-   `08/07/2021` Make external links open new tab\n	* [How to Make Links Open in a New Window or Tab (thesitewizard.com)](https://www.thesitewizard.com/html-tutorial/open-links-in-new-window-or-tab.shtml#:~:text=How%20to%20Open%20Hyperlinks%20in,your%20links%20(anchor%20tags).\u0026text=Now%20when%20your%20visitors%20click,how%20they%20configured%20that%20browser)\n\n***Lol look at that struggle...*** 🐒\n![github-struggle](/photos/github-struggle.png)",title:"Building this Website"},"/home/corner":{content:'---\ntitle: "Chloe\'s Corner"\ndate: Aug 4, 2021\nnotoc: true\n---\n\n\u003e Note: #in-progress/garden \n\n- [Tooling](moc/tooling)\n- [To Read](moc/to-read.md)\n- **Things at the top of my ahead I want to learn about** #come-back \n	- [Organization structures](notes/career/hr/org-structures.md)\n	- [Authenticity](notes/perdev/life-advice/authenticity.md)\n	- [Project roadmapping](notes/project-roadmapping.md)\n\n`08112021` **2~ weeks with Obsidian!** The pink ones are my private notes while the blue ones are the ones in this garden! ✌️\n![obsidian-graph](/photos/obsidian-graph.png)',title:"Chloe's Corner"},"/home/garden":{content:"---\ntitle: \"On Digital Gardens\"\n---\n\nThis digital garden is one of my personal projects this year! I'm still learning if there's a *proper* way of setting it up.\n\nI realized how unconducive for permanence my past notes were. I literally have too much bookmark managers + mind dumps *(thanks Apple Notes, Telegram, Messenger, Mem.ai for keeping up with me)*.\n\nThis digital garden serves as my **personal knowledge management** system. I'm a really forgetful person who tends to highlight stuff and tbh rarely comes back to them! 😪 I want to overcome the [forgetting curve](notes/sources/books/book-notes/forgetting-curve.md) because there's so much to learn and love. 🌸\n\n\u003e This digital garden is powered by [Obsidian,](https://obsidian.md/) [Quartz,](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) and [Github.](https://github.com/)\n\n---\n\n## What's a digital garden?\n\u003e \"*A digital garden is an online space at the intersection of a notebook and a blog, where digital gardeners share seeds of thoughts to be cultivated in public. Contrary to a blog, where articles and essays have a publication date and start decaying as soon as they are published, a digital garden is evergreen: digital gardeners keep on editing and refining their notes.*\" [Ness Labs](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up)\n\n## Why build a digital garden?\nI love how this garden puts it:\n![photo](/photos/amar-garden.png)\n*Screenshot from: [Anthomy Amar](https://garden.anthonyamar.fr/Welcome+in+my+mind+%F0%9F%A7%A0)*\n\nSo yeah, what motivated me into building my own garden is how much it offered authenticity and how it opens up to new conversations and ideas with different people. I think it's a really good way to share ideas–from the most fleshed out and developed ones to the premature atomic ones! I also hope to inspire someone to start their digital garden too! 🪴🍃\n\n\u003e “He who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but he also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.” — Richard Hamming\n\n## Tools\n- [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) I built mine here! 💘\n- [Setting up your own digital garden with Jekyll](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll)\n\n## Inspirations\n- [Joschua's Garden](https://joschuasgarden.com/)\n- [Tom Critchlow](http://tomcritchlow.com/)\n- [Joel's Digital Garden](https://joelhooks.com/)\n- [Anthony Amar](https://garden.anthonyamar.fr/Welcome+in+my+mind+%F0%9F%A7%A0)\n- [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden)\n\n\n## Sources\n### Digital Gardens\n- [How to set up your own digital garden](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up)\n- [A Brief History \u0026 Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)\n- [Building a digital garden](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/)\n\n### Other Helpful Links on Getting Started\n- [PKM Primer: An Introduction to Personal Knowledge Management for Creatives](https://thesweetsetup.com/pkm-intro-for-creatives/)\n- [A Beginner’s Guide to the Zettelkasten Method](https://zenkit.com/en/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-the-zettelkasten-method/) Still trying to learn how to integrate this to my system 😶‍🌫️\n- [How To Take Evergreen Notes (Part 4 In Series)](https://mikegiannulis.com/how-to-take-evergreen-notes/)\n- [The Second Brain - A Life-Changing Productivity System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP3dA2GcAh8)\n- [Building a Second Brain: An Overview](https://fortelabs.co/blog/basboverview/)\n\n### Related Reads\n- [Learn In Public: The fastest way to learn](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/)",title:"On Digital Gardens"},"/home/navigate":{content:"---\ntitle: \"Navigating the Garden\"\n---\n\nHello! 👋 Thank you so much for being here! In this page, I map out how this garden is structured for ease of navigation. There are a lot of links \u0026 backlinks, so it can get confusing! 😵‍💫\n\n## Structure 🏛\nDigital gardens are composed of notes that are interlinked for the purpose of linking thinking. As such, there are notes inside notes.\n\nI structured my garden in this manner from when you navigate from the homepage. While it does seem linear, all notes are actually interconnected! So you can jump from one note to another and find one note also in another note.\n\nI talk more about the notes system more in [gardening-system.](notes/home/gardening-system.md) Here's a basic outline of what navigating looks like:\n\n![garden-new-structure](/photos/garden-new-structure.png)\n\n### Basically... 🎧\n- Home 🏡\n	- Entry point towards all the notes. The main points of navigation and entry points are stored there.\n- **From the Home** 🗺\n	- **Main Maps of Content** 🌞\n		- I store these at the home page. I sorted these according to overarching ideas or themes between some notes. They contain general topics that branch to specific topics as you enter.\n	- **Projects** 🥰\n		- The projects sections contain the projects I publish (more of the thinking processes instead of the final product!).\n- **Types of Notes** 🤩\n	- From the entry points, I have different types of notes. I talk more about the notes system more in [gardening-system.](notes/home/gardening-system.md) Essentially, here are the types of notes:\n		- #permanent-notes 🫀\n			- In these notes, I write in the highlights I read and the thought processes I generated along with them.\n		- #personal-learnings  ✍️\n			- These notes contain solely my writings from personal learnings.\n		- #repository  💳\n			- These notes contain links and sources for the theme associated with them.\n- **Others** 🥳\n	- **Related Notes** 🚗\n		- The related notes section contains all the notes in which the current note you are in is mentioned. They're all clickable!\n	- **Interactive Graph** 📊\n		- The interactive graph displays the connections between the different notes. They're all clickable, and you can jump from one note to another from here.\n\n---\n\n## How-to 🤔\n\n### Using the Page Links 🔗\n- The basic way to navigate is to go through the links as connected between the pages.\n\n### Using the Related Notes/ Backlinks 🛀\n- At the bottom of the page is the **Related Notes** section. These contain all the notes in which the **current note is mentioned**. They're all clickable too! 🐭\n\n### Using the Interactive Graph 📈\n- The **teal circle** represents where you are within the garden of notes. Hovering to a certain point reveals the connections between the notes, and you can jump from one note to another from here.\n\n\n---\n## If you're still reading this... 💖\nI'd just like to say thanks for taking the time to roam around here. 🥺 I hope it inspires someone to start up a digital garden too! 🪴",title:"Navigating the Garden"},"/home/roadmap":{content:"---\ntitle: \"Roadmap\"\nnotoc: true\n---\n\n\u003e I have super scrappy baseline knowledge in code.

They are part of a brand's design by identity, packaging, communications, and environments.\n### Importance\n- Good brand experience connects more with the audience in a way that it sticks with them more and facilitates deeper connections. This highlights a brand's selling point and ultimately attracts a customer and makes them stay.\n### Brand-related stimuli\n#### Dimensions\n1. Sensory\n2. Affective\n3. Intellectual\n4.

Be personal and unique.\n\n## Highlights\n- [How to create an awesome brand experience - 99designs](https://99designs.com/blog/logo-branding/brand-experience/)[^1]\n	- What is brand experience\n		- “Brand” is the company, as perceived by the world. Your brand defines why you are in existence, your raison d’être. “Experience” on the other hand describes how you live and grow. Therefore, brand experience quite literally describes ==how the brand is experienced by potential and existing customers before, during and after any and all interactions, throughout its existence.==\n		- The most well known brands that exist today place strong emphasis on brand experience. ==Apple is an obvious example. From the retail store, to the packaging, to the interface, all the points in which we interact with Apple are curated and harmonious with the overall brand experience.==\n	- Elements that create a successful brand experience\n		- Brand design\n		- Brand voice\n		- User experience\n		- Brand image, and\n		- Customer support\n	- How-to\n		- Discover your purpose\n			- Defining who you are will set the tone of the type of experience you want to create. In an oversaturated market, products that are connected to a bigger purpose can stand out from the crowd—the purpose often has more value than the product itself. What is your brand’s higher purpose?\n		- Focus on storytelling\n			- What’s your brand’s story?  How did you come to be? How are you improving lives?\n		- Be consistent\n		- Find opportunities for engagement\n		- Put experiences over sales\n- Brand Experience:What Is It? How Is It Measured? Does It Affect Loyalty?[^2]\n	- Brand experience is conceptualized as ==sensations, feelings, cognitions, and behavioral responses evoked by brand-related stimuli== that are part of a brand’s design and identity, packaging, communications, and environments.\n	- However, they are also exposed to various specific brand-related stimuli, such as ==brand-identifying colors== (Bellizzi and Hite 1992; Gorn et al. 1997; Meyers-Levy and Peracchio 1995), ==shapes== (Veryzer and Hutchinson 1998), typefaces, background design elements (Mandel and Johnson 2002), ==slogans, mascots, and brand characters== (Keller 1987). These brand-related stimuli appear as part of a brand’s design and identity (e.g., name, logo, signage), packaging, and marketing communications (e.g., advertisements, brochures, Web sites) and in environments in which the brand is marketed or sold (e.g., stores, events). These brand-related stimuli constitute the major source of subjective, internal consumer responses, which we refer to as “brand experience.”\n	- Thus, we conceptualize brand experience as ==subjective, internal consumer responses (sensations, feelings, and cognitions) and behavioral responses== evoked by brand-related stimuli that are part of a brand’s design and identity, packaging, communications, and environments.\n	- In line with our conceptualization, the experience dimensions are evoked by brand-related stimuli (e.g., ==colors, shapes, typefaces, designs, slogans, mascots, brand characters==). Note that there is no one-to-one correspondence, such that a certain stimulus type would trigger a certain experience dimension and only that dimension. \n	- As Table 1 shows, participants provided descriptions of sensations (e.g., “touch and feel,” “appeal to different senses,” “smells nice and is visually warm”), a wide range of feelings (e.g., “fun,” “refreshed,” “inspired,” “nostalgia”), analytical and imaginative thoughts (e.g., “the brand intrigues me,” “I think of topics like animal testing, purity and wellness,” “reminds me to use my imagination”), and behaviors (e.g., “I change the way I organize and interact with information,” “I want to work out,” “It’s a place I want to go”).\n	- Accordingly, we conceptualized brand experience as ==subjective consumer responses that are evoked by specific brand-related experiential attributes in such settings.== We demonstrated that brand experience can be broken down into four dimensions (==sensory, affective, intellectual, and behavioral==), which are differentially evoked by various brands.\n\n![brand-xp-1](/photos/brand-xp-1.png)\n![brand-xp-2](/photos/brand-xp-2.png)\n\n- [Brand Experience: What is it and How Do You Maximize It? | Widen](https://www.widen.com/blog/brand-experience)\n	- Brand experience is the ==sum of all the sensations, thoughts, feelings, and reactions== that individuals have in response to a brand. Brand experience is not specific to a channel or media type. Rather, it’s the result — or the lasting impression — that ==remains after someone encounters or engages with a brand in any environment==.\n	- UX vs brand xp\n		- Unlike brand experience, ==user experience speaks specifically to a person’s takeaway from their interaction with a brand’s products, services, people, software, or other offerings==. For example, customers will have a positive user experience if they receive fast and effective customer service, a frictionless checkout process, or an easy-to-use product. \n	- Importance\n		- Brand experience is important because ==positive experiences facilitate deeper connections, inspire audiences, and ultimately deliver results.== A positive brand experience can often mean the ==difference between being chosen over another brand or losing the sale.== Because of this, it’s easy to see why companies go out of their way to craft impressive and attention-grabbing brand experiences.\n	- How-to\n		- Engage the senses\n		- Participate in events\n		- Participate in popular culture\n		- Personalize the message\n\n\n[^1]: [How to create an awesome brand experience - 99designs](https://99designs.com/blog/logo-branding/brand-experience/)\n[^2]: [Brand Experience:What Is It?

Some examples are unending workstream, unjust compenstation, etc.\n- Burnout within organization is not something that can be solved through "days-off" and "giving people self-care apps". The best way to approach this problem is through looking at the causes of burnout.\n\n## Highlights\n- These “extra days off” and “mental health resources” do not solve the problem. If you’re slammed with work, you can’t take the days off because you need to get the work done. No amount of talking to a tele-therapist will finish those iMeet logs, Excel files and PowerPoint decks all on the same damn projects that you’re stressed out of your mind trying to get done by deadline.\n- burnout is caused by working with seemingly no end. It is a form of exhaustion. It is not, at its core, a mental health issue - it is an issue with being overloaded and having no respite from said overload, and trying to solve it by offering “mental health” and “wellness” and “meditation” stuff is disingenuous.\n- The cause of burnout is usually too much work, and the solution to too much work is to make sure they have more time to do their work or add more people so that they have less work to do. It’s a symptom of someone being overwhelmed by the tasks they’re receiving or the way they’re receiving the tasks, and is - that’s right folks! - regularly caused by bad management and organizational mechanisms.\n- If a company actually wants to deal with burnout, you should find out what causes burnout and then deal with that. Oftentimes it isn’t just the volume of work, but the conditions in which said work is done, which is often caused by middle managers that exist only to delegate and never to assist or empower.\n- The solution isn’t to look at workers and say “okay, you’ve got burnout, time to relax,” but to look at the root causes and work out how to avoid that in the future, be it through not piling on so much work at once or giving them direct assistance to do the work.\n- Burnout is not a mental health issue, it is an organizational issue that causes mental and physical health issues.',title:"Burnout is an organizational issue"},"/notes/buyer-personas":{content:'---\ntitle: "Buyer personas"\ndate: Aug 19, 2021\n---\n\n- **Tags:**#i #in-progress/garden \n- **Relevant Notes**\n\n## Sources\n- [Buyer Persona Template \u0026 Persona Examples - Milanote](https://milanote.com/templates/marketing/buyer-persona)\n## Notes\n\n## Highlights',title:"Buyer personas"},"/notes/candidate-red-flags":{content:'---\ntitle: "Candidate red flags"\ndate: Aug 12, 2021\n---\n\n- **Tags:** #permanent-notes \n- **Relevant Notes**\n	- [getting-hired](notes/getting-hired.md)\n	- [interviews](notes/interviews.md)\n\n\n## Notes [^1]\n1.

The stress is on recycling, made possible by designing products so that they can easily be taken apart.\n\nSeveral scientific studies (see references) describe the concept as an “idealised vision”, a “mix of various ideas from different domains”, or a “vague idea based on pseudo-scientific concepts”. There’s three main points of criticism, which we discuss below.\n\n1. **The first dent in the credibility of the circular economy is the fact that the recycling process of modern products is far from 100% efficient.**\n    1. The more complex a product, the more steps and processes it takes to recycle. In each step of this process, resources and energy are lost.\n    2. Furthermore, in the case of electronic products, the production process itself is much more resource-intensive than the extraction of the raw materials, meaning that recycling the end product can only recuperate a fraction of the input.\n    3. And while some plastics are indeed being recycled, this process only produces inferior materials (“downcycling”) that enter the waste stream soon afterwards.\n    4. The low efficiency of the recycling process is, on its own, enough to take the ground from under the concept of the circular economy: the loss of resources during the recycling process always needs to be compensated with more over-extraction of the planet’s resources. Recycling processes will improve, but recycling is always a trade-off between maximum material recovery and minimum energy use. And that brings us to the next point.\n2. **How can you recycle energy sources?**\n    1. The second dent in the credibility of the circular economy is the fact that 20% of total resources used worldwide are fossil fuels. More than 98% of that is burnt as a source of energy and can’t be re-used or recycled.\n    2. As energy is transferred or transformed, its quality diminishes (second law of thermodynamics). For example, it’s impossible to operate one car or one power plant with the excess heat from another. Consequently, there will always be a need to mine new fossil fuels. Besides, recycling materials also requires energy, both through the recycling process and the transportation of recycled and to-be-recycled materials.\n    3. To this, the supporters of the circular economy have a response: we will shift to 100% renewable energy. But this doesn’t make the circle round: to build and maintain renewable energy plants and accompanied infrastructures, we also need resources (both energy and materials). What’s more, technology to harvest and store renewable energy relies on difficult-to-recycle materials. That’s why solar panels, wind turbines and lithium-ion batteries are not recycled, but landfilled or incinerated.\n3. **Input exceeds output**\n    1. The third dent in the credibility of the circular economy is the biggest: the global resource use – both energetic and material – keeps increasing year by year.\n4. **Accumulation of resources**\n    1. A considerable segment of all resources – about a third of the total – are neither recycled, nor incinerated or dumped: they are accumulated in buildings, infrastructure, and consumer goods. In 2005, 62 Gt of resources were used globally. After subtracting energy sources (fossil fuels and biomass) and waste from the mining sector, the remaining 30 Gt were used to make material goods. Of these, 4 Gt was used to make products that last for less than one year (disposable products).\n\nA more responsible use of resources is of course an excellent idea. But to achieve that, recycling and re-use alone aren’t enough. Since 71% of all resources cannot be recycled or re-used (44% of which are energy sources and 27% of which are added to existing stocks), you can only really get better numbers by reducing total use.\n\n\n\n[^1]: [How Circular is the Circular Economy? - Local Futures](https://www.localfutures.org/how-circular-is-the-circular-economy/)',title:"Circular Economy"},"/notes/collective-effervesence":{content:'---\ntitle: "Collective Effervesence"\n---\n\n- **Tags:** #to-digest \n- **Relevant Notes**\n	- [notes/emotions-contagious](notes/emotions-contagious.md)\n\n\n## Notes\n\n## Highlights\n- We find our greatest bliss in moments of collective effervescence. It’s a concept coined in the early 20th century by the pioneering sociologist Émile Durkheim to describe the sense of energy and harmony people feel when they come together in a group around a shared purpose. Collective effervescence is the synchrony you feel when you slide into rhythm with strangers on a dance floor, colleagues in a brainstorming session, cousins at a religious service or teammates on a soccer field. And during this pandemic, it’s been largely absent from our lives.[^1]\n	- Collective effervescence happens when joie de vivre spreads through a group. Before Covid, research showed that more than three-quarters of people found collective effervescence at least once a week and almost a third experienced it at least once a day.\n	- You can feel depressed and anxious alone, but it’s rare to laugh alone or love alone.

However, this idea that the "climb should be hard" is not progress, we are instead putting on research debt.\n- Research debt can come in the form of poor exposition, undigested ideas, bad abstractations and notation, and noise.\n- When faced with these, people have to exert interpretative labor which varies depending on the material presented.\n- [We must move forward into research distillation](notes/research-distillation.md). While many people want to do this, there are barriers such as: perverse incentive, don\'t enjoy distillation, [there is lack of support in research](notes/lack-of-support-in-research.md).\n\n## Highlights\n[Research Debt](https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/)[^1]\n- The climb isn’t progress: the climb is a mountain of debt.\n- Research can also have debt.\n	- Poor Exposition\n	- Undigested Ideas \n	- Bad abstractions and notation - Unfortunately, we often get stuck with the first formalisms to develop even when they’re bad. \n	- Noise \n- Interpretaive Labor\n- There’s a tradeoff between the energy put into explaining an idea, and the energy needed to understand it. \n- On the other extreme, the explainer can do the absolute minimum and abandon their audience to struggle. This energy is called interpretive labor.\n- In these one-to-many cases, each member of the audience pays the cost of understanding, even though the cost of explaining stays the same. 3 As a result, the cost of understanding has a multiplier in the interpretive labor tradeoff — sometimes a huge multiplier. 4\n- Just like before, the cost of explaining stays constant as the group grows, but the cost of understanding increases with each new member.\n- Young ideas aren’t ending points for us to put in a paper and abandon. When we let things stop there the debt piles up. It becomes harder to understand and build on each other’s work and the field fragments.\n- It’s a lack of digesting ideas – or, at least, a lack of the public version of ideas being digested. \n- Research distillation\n- Research distillation is the opposite of research debt. It can be incredibly satisfying, combining deep scientific understanding, empathy, and design to do justice to our research and lay bare beautiful insights.\n- Distillation is also hard. It’s tempting to think of explaining an idea as just putting a layer of polish on it, but good explanations often involve transforming the idea.\n- This leaves us with no easy way out. We can’t solve research debt by having one person write a textbook: their energy is spread too thin to polish every idea from scratch. We can’t outsource distillation to less skilled non-experts: refining and explaining ideas requires creativity and deep understanding, just as much as novel research.\n- Where are the distillers?\n	- Perverse incentives, like wanting your work to look difficult. Those certainly exist, but we don’t think they’re the main factor. 6 Another possibility is that they don’t enjoy research distillation. Again, we don’t think that’s what’s going on.\n	- We don’t support them. 7\n	- An aspiring research distiller lacks many things that are easy to take for granted: a career path, places to learn, examples and role models. Underlying this is a deeper issue: their work isn’t seen as a real research contribution. We need to fix this.\n\n\n\n[^1]: [Research Debt](https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/)',title:"Make research accessible to the public"},"/notes/emotions-contagious":{content:'---\ntitle: "Emotions are contagious"\n---\n\n- **Tags:** #permanent-notes \n- **Relevant Notes**\n	- [collective-effervesence](notes/collective-effervesence.md)\n\n\n## Notes\n- You feel the emotions around the people around you. Some examples of these are collective anxiety, Zoom fatigue, etc.\n\n## Highlights\n- When the pandemic began in 2020, the first negative emotion to spread was fear. Waves of panic crashed through communities, compelling people to purify packages and hoard hand sanitizer. As too many people lost loved ones, too many others lost jobs and everyone lost some semblance of normal life. The number of adults with symptoms of depression or anxiety spiked from one in 10 Americans to about four in 10.[^1]\n	- And there’s reason to believe these symptoms haven’t been caused only by the crisis itself — they’ve actually been transferred from person to person. Studies show that if your spouse, your family member or your roommate develops depression, you’re at heightened risk for it. And contagion isn’t limited to face-to-face interaction: Emotions can spread through social media posts and text messages, too.\n\n[^1]: [There’s a Specific Kind of Joy We’ve Been Missing](https://www-nytimes-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.nytimes.com/2021/07/10/opinion/sunday/covid-group-emotions-happiness.amp.html)',title:"Emotions are contagious"},"/notes/empathy":{content:'---\ntitle: "Empathy"\nnotoc: true\n---\n\n- [We are unkind because we our empathy is limited](notes/perdev/kindness/unkind.md.)\n- [Empathy is in admitting that we don\'t understand](notes/perdev/kindness/dont-understand.md)',title:"Empathy"},"/notes/ethics-activities":{content:'---\ntitle: "Ethics Activities"\ndate: Aug 5, 2021\nnotoc: true\n---\n\n- [Ethics Litmus Tests](https://www.ethical-litmus.site/)\n	- [PDF Version](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e37fdff744ec95bb01b2d78/t/5ea16e5ef09f7c126e43b392/1587637871092/ethics-litmus-tests-web.pdf)',title:"Ethics Activities"},"/notes/expressing-emotions":{content:"---\ntitle: \"On expressing emotions\"\ndate: Aug 8, 2021\nnotoc: true\n---\n\n- [We often think someone doesn't express emotion because they don't want to, but what if they just don't feel any](notes/sciences/psycho/expressing-emotions/dont-want-to-express.md)",title:"On expressing emotions"},"/notes/facebook-v-organic":{content:"---\ntitle: \"What works for social does not work for organic\"\ndate: Aug 18, 2021\nnotoc: true\n---\n\n- **Tags:** #permanent-notes \n- **Relevant Notes**\n	- [marketing-tooling](notes/marketing-tooling.md)\n\n\n## Notes\n- What works for social does not work for organic.

Our words are too powerful to impart things callously. I've seen people give feedback differently, and I think there's no super perfect formula into giving it because people are so unpredictable and subjective. I adjust my approach, but what I always seek to maintain is to relay feedback in a **constructive manner that helps a person move forward concretely**.\n\nA common argument against taking a very systematic and calculated approach is that we take away the directness of things. However, [directness just isn't an excuse to be an asshole.](notes/perdev/better/directness.md) You can find balance into creating [safe spaces](notes/perdev/mh/safe-spaces.md), [psychological safety](notes/psychological-safety.md), and being candid.\n\n---\n\n## Guiding Principles\n1. Give feedback that is and think-forward.\n2. Seek to let people improve.\n3. Understand that everyone always has room for improvement!\n4. Focus on actions and results.\n5. Leave emotions out *(but don't be insensitive!)*.\n6. Stay growth-minded! 🍃\n\n## How I Give Feedback\nI follow a three step approach into giving feedback. \n\n1. **Highlight the assets of the work.**\n	- I believe the secret into making feedback that sticks and ultimately helps a person move forward is to build the relationship on mutual trust. First focusing on building rapport establishes this and catches a person's attention.\n	- How this looks like would be in the following:\n		- \"I like how you...\"\n2. **Relay the specific feedback constructively.**\n	- Words are powerful. Feedback may either motivate a person to do better or change a person's mindset towards progressing in what they're doing. Constructive criticsm is a manner in which are frank about what we want to criticize and relay it in a manner that is constructive, not destructive.\n	- Seek to let the person understand where you're coming from. This doesn't have to be done explicitly\n	- Instead of \"*This looks terrible...\",* say *\"This has a lot of room for improvement, and we can work around it!\"*\n3. **Suggest steps to move forward.**\n	- Be action-oriented in the feedback approach. I think concrete steps on how to move forward are better than suddenly taking over and micromanaging something. Letting people facilitate their own growth is a good way through actually doing something to improve promotes good team dynamics.\n	- Specific steps also serve as a good jumpstart for people. Stay growth-minded!\n\n\nWhen combined, this approach looks like this in a design team example:\n\u003e Hi, `Chloe`! I recently came across your `latest pubmat`. I love how you adapted `a new approach into combining the elements, plus your palette!`. However, I think there are still ways in which we can improve the `combination of fonts`. Can you try `Inter/ Montserrat here at this bottom part`? I also suggest `trying out this photo asset at this websitexyz`. Thank you, and I look forward to hearing from you!\n\n\n\n## Good Reads\n- [The secret to giving great feedback | The Way We Work, a TED series - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtl5UrrgU8c)\n- [How to Give Feedback: 5 Tips for Constructive Criticism](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/how-to-give-good-feedback-at-work)",title:"Feedback"},"/notes/focus-on-user":{content:'---\ntitle: "Focus on your user and everything else will follow"\n---\n\n- **Tags:** #to-digest \n- **Relevant Notes**\n	- [human-centric design](moc/ux-design.md)\n\n\n## Notes\n\n\n## Highlights\n- If you do a quick search to understand the ROI (return on investment) of focusing on your users, you’ll quickly learn that customer-focused companies can be 60% more profitable than non-customer-focused companies.[^1]\n\n[^1]: [Survey Design Guide: Process, Principles, and Questions | Maze](https://maze.co/guides/survey-design/?)',title:"Focus on your user and everything else will follow"},"/notes/general-interview-questions":{content:"---\ntitle: \"General interview questions and how to answer\"\ndate: Aug 11, 2021\n---\n\n- **Tags:** #permanent-notes #personal-learnings \n- **Relevant Notes**\n	- [career-advice](moc/career-advice.md)\n	- [notes/skills/hr/getting-hired](notes/getting-hired.md)\n	- [ty-note](notes/ty-note.md)\n	- [what-do-recruiters-want](notes/what-do-recruiters-want.md)\n\n\n## General Techniques\n1. STAR Method\n	- **SITUATION:** Give the interviewer context by describing the situation.\n	- **TASK:** What did you need to do? \n	- **ACTION:**  What were your specific actions?\n	- **RESULT:** What was the end result? What did you learn? How did it affect others?\n2. Elevator Pitch\n3. Problem-Solution-Benefit[^1]\n	- Answer should contain: A problem you faced, Your solution, The benefit to your employer.\n	- Sample\n		- *(Problem)* I had to work with another programmer who complained a lot about our projects.\n		- *(Solution)* I took the time to learn about his personal life. It turned out he was going through a tough divorce. Once I got to know him, he was actually a great coworker.\n		- *(Benefit to employer)* We worked so well together after that we were the most efficient programming pair in the company.\n4. CAR Method\n	- Challenge\n	- Actions\n	- Result\n\n## General Tips\n1. Stay honest.\n2. Use research to guide your answer.\n3. Convey healthy enthusiasm.\n4. Be prepared.	\n5. Draw from the job description.\n6. Prepare specific examples.\n7. Take your time answering.\n\n## How to Prepare for the Interview\n1. Research the company and your interviewers.\n2. Practice your answers to common interview questions.\n3. Study the job description and note required skills, qualities, and experience.\n4. Answer the questions using the STAR Method.\n5. Recruit a friend to practice answering questions.\n6. Be prepared with examples of your work.\n7. Plan your interview attire the night before.\n8. Prepare smart questions for your interviewers.\n9. Bring copies of your resume, a notebook, and pen.\n10. Tie your answers back to your skills and accomplishments.\n\n## Questions\nGeneral Sources[^2] [^3] [^1] [^4]\n### General, Informational\n1. Tell me about yourself.\n	- Approach A [^3]\n		- Start by describing your \u003cu\u003ebackground with a summary of your most impressive responsibilities\u003c/u\u003e\n			- *\"I've been a hostess at XYZ Restaurant for just over two years where I greet and seat customers, assess wait times, fulfill to-go orders and answer the phones. I love the lively and busy environment—we often have Friday and Saturday wait times of one hour or more...”*\n		- Next, briefly summarize your previous experience with \u003cu\u003ekey achievements\u003c/u\u003e\n			- **\"...Before working at XYZ Restaurant, I worked in retail as a floor associate for five years. Working in retail developed the customer service skills that make me a great hostess, offering a top-tier dining experience from the moment customers walk in the door. It also equipped me with the ability to work quickly under pressure...\"*\n		- Lastly, express how you found the new job and why it's a good fit for you and your goals\n			- *\"...I've enjoyed and grown in my current role, but wish to expand and utilize my customer service expertise in an elite restaurant environment. I am interested in your restaurant because of its reputation for delivering first in class service to your patrons in a lively, dynamic environment.”*\n	- Approach B\n		- FORD Method\n			- Family\n			- Occupation\n			- Recreation\n			- Dream\n2. Why do you want to work here? [^5] [^6]\n	- Don't answer something that's selfish. Think of it as \u003cu\u003e“Why would this company want to hire me?”\u003c/u\u003e\n	- Ask yourself:\n	- \u003cu\u003eHow can you help the company succeed?\u003c/u\u003e\n		- Read up on what’s happening with the company and its industry. Has it recently changed its product or service offerings? What competitive pressures is it facing? Consider this landscape and think, “What knowledge and experience do I have that would be especially useful to this employer right now?”\n    - \u003cu\u003eWhat past career successes could you potentially repeat at this company?\u003c/u\u003e\n		- In previous jobs, how did you meet or exceed your employers’ expectations? What problems did you play a major role in solving? What ideas did you introduce that helped the company save money or otherwise boost its bottom line? What lessons have you learned that you could apply in the future to create value for the potential employer?\n	- \u003cu\u003eHow will you complement the company’s culture?\u003c/u\u003e\n		- A candidate’s ability to fit within the organizational culture is an important hiring factor for many employers. So, do your homework on the company’s culture and **identify what you find most appealing about it.** For instance, if the firm encourages entrepreneurial thinking and that’s important to you, include that in your response.\n    - Examples\n        - *“I see this opportunity as a way to contribute to an exciting/forward-thinking/fast-moving company/industry, and I feel I can do so by/with my … ”*\n        - *“I feel my skills are particularly well-suited to this position because … ”*\n        - *“I believe I have the type of knowledge to succeed in this role and at the company because … ”*\n        - *“I’m excited about this job opportunity, as it would allow me to … ”*\n3. What's your most impressive win in your career this far?\n	- Tells of what does this person think is successful. Is it really impressive?[^12]\n4. Why should we hire you?\n	- **EXPERIENCE** Show that you have \u003cu\u003eskills and experience\u003c/u\u003e to do the job and deliver great results.\n	- **WORK CULTURE** Highlight that \u003cu\u003eyou’ll fit in and be a great addition\u003c/u\u003e to the team.\n	- **IMPACT** Describe how hiring you will make their life easier and help them achieve more.\n	- **CAPABILITY** Show enthusiasm for performing required duties, not just capability.\n	- *Sample:* Oh wow, where do I begin! I have been an avid traveler since as young as I can remember. When I reached adulthood and started booking flights for myself, your airline would be my top choice. Alpha Airlines has always made long-distance travel a pleasure, and I would be honored to say that I work for you. On top of this, I believe that my patience and multitasking skills are second to none, and these would go a long way in helping me the best flight attendant possible.\n	- *What not to answer:* Money, perks, skills, desperation, general interest\n5. What can you bring to the company?\n6. Can you explain why your background and experience would be a good fit for this job?\n	- *Sample:* I certainly can! Well, from what I’ve read on your company’s roadmap plans posted online, it sounds like you need a project manager who is capable of handling other departmental roles, as well. I couldn’t find a way to succinctly describe it on my resume, but during my internship at BioGenCo, I spent a month each on five different teams to get a handle on how the company functions as a whole. Now, with my supervisory experience where I’ve raised output by 32%, I believe I am well equipped to be the best project manager, while also being knowledgeable of the roles of other departments.\n7.

Where then do I look for good and evil? Not to uncontrollable externals, but within myself to the choices that are my own . . .” Epictetus\n\nThe single most important practice in Stoic philosophy is differentiating between what we can change and what we can’t. What we have influence over and what we do not. A flight is delayed because of weather— no amount of yelling at an airline representative will end a storm. No amount of wishing will make you taller or shorter or born in a different country. No matter how hard you try, you can’t make someone like you. And on top of that, time spent hurling yourself at these immovable objects is time not spent on the things we can change.\n\n### Journal\n\n“Few care now about the marches and countermarches of the Roman commanders. What the centuries have clung to is a notebook of thoughts by a man whose real life was largely unknown who put down in the midnight dimness not the events of the day or the plans of the morrow, but something of far more permanent interest, the ideals and aspirations that a rare spirit lived by.” — Brand Blanshard\n\n### Practice Misfortune\nSeneca, who enjoyed great wealth as the adviser of Nero, suggested that we ought to set aside a certain number of days each month to practice poverty. Take a little food, wear your worst clothes, get away from the comfort of your home and bed. Put yourself face to face with want, he said, you’ll ask yourself “Is this what I used to dread?”\n\nPractice what you fear, whether a simulation in your mind or in real life. The downside is almost always reversible or transient.\n\n### Train Perceptions\n\n“Choose not to be harmed and you won’t feel harmed. Don’t feel harmed and you haven’t been.” — Marcus Aurelius*\n\nSuppose for a second that you are trying to help someone and they respond by being surly or unwilling to cooperate. Instead of making your life more difficult, the exercise says, they’re actually directing you towards new virtues; for example, patience or understanding. Or, the death of someone close to you; a chance to show fortitude.\n\n"The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.”*\n\n### Remember - It\'s All Ephemeral\n\n“Run down the list of those who felt intense anger at something: the most famous, the most unfortunate, the most hated, the most whatever: Where is all that now? Smoke, dust, legend…or not even a legend. Think of all the examples. And how trivial the things we want so passionately are.”*\n\nIt is important to note that ‘passion’ here isn’t the modern usage we’re familiar with as in enthusiasm or caring about something. As Don Robertson explains in his book, when the Stoics discuss overcoming ‘passions’, which they called patheiai, they refer to the irrational, unhealthy and excessive desires and emotions. Anger would be a good example. What is important to remember, and this is the crucial bit, they seek to replace them with eupatheiai, such as joy instead of excessive pleasure.\n\nRemember that achievements can be ephemeral, and that your possession of them is for just an instant.\n\n*If everything is ephemeral, what does matter? Right now matters. Being a good person and doing the right thing right now, that’s what matters and that’s what was important to the Stoics.*\n\n## Take the View From Above\n\n“How beautifully Plato put it. Whenever you want to talk about people, it’s best to take a bird’s- eye view and see everything all at once— of gatherings, armies, farms, weddings and divorces, births and deaths, noisy courtrooms or silent spaces, every foreign people, holidays, memorials, markets— all blended together and arranged in a pairing of opposites.” — Marcus Aurelius\n\nMarcus would often practice an exercise that is referred to as “taking the view from above” or “Plato’s view.” It invites us to take a step back, zoom out and see life from a higher vantage point than our own. This exercise—envisioning all the millions and millions of people, all the “armies, farms, weddings and divorces, births and deaths”—prompts us to take perspective and just like the previous exercise, remind us how small we are. It reorients us, and as Stoic scholar Pierre Hadot put it, **“*The view from above changes our value judgments on things: luxury, power, war…and the worries of everyday life become ridiculous.”***\n\nSeeing how small we are in the grand scheme of things is only one portion of this exercise. The second, more subtle point, is to tap into what the Stoics call sympatheia, or a mutual interdependence with the whole of humanity. As the astronaut Edgar Mitchell, one of the first people to actually experience a real ‘view from above’ put it, “In outer space you develop an instant global consciousness, a people orientation, an intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world, and a compulsion to do something about it.” Take a step back from your own concerns and remind yourself of your duty to others. Take Plato’s view.\n\n### Memento Mori: Meditate on Your Mortality\n“Let us prepare our minds as if we’d come to the very end of life. Let us postpone nothing. Let us balance life’s books each day. … The one who puts the finishing touches on their life each day is never short of time.” Seneca*\n\n## Premeditatio Malorum → Premeditation of Evils\n“What is quite unlooked for is more crushing in its effect, and unexpectedness adds to the weight of a disaster. This is a reason for ensuring that nothing ever takes us by surprise. We should project our thoughts ahead of us at every turn and have in mind every possible eventuality instead of only the usual course of events… Rehearse them in your mind: exile, torture, war, shipwreck. All the terms of our human lot should be before our eyes.” — Seneca***\n\nThe premeditatio malorum (“the pre-meditation of evils”) is a Stoic exercise of imagining things that could go wrong or be taken away from us. It helps us prepare for life’s inevitable setbacks. We don’t always get what is rightfully ours, even if we’ve earned it. Not everything is as clean and straightforward as we think they may be. Psychologically, we must prepare ourselves for this to happen. It is one of the most powerful exercise in the Stoics’ toolkit to build resilience and strength.\n\n### Amor Fati\n\n“To love only what happens, what was destined. No greater harmony.” — Marcus Aurelius*\nThe great German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche would describe his formula for human greatness as amor fati—a love of fate. “That one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backwards, not in all eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it….but love it.”\n\nThe Stoics were not only familiar with this attitude but they embraced it. Two thousand years ago, writing in his own personal journal which would become known as Meditations, Emperor Marcus Aurelius would say: “A blazing fire makes flame and brightness out of everything that is thrown into it.” Another Stoic, Epictetus, who as a crippled slave has faced adversity after adversity, echoed the same: \n***“Do not seek for things to happen the way you want them to; rather, wish that what happens happen the way it happens: then you will be happy.”***',title:"How to Be Stoic"},"/notes/how-to-apologize":{content:'---\ntitle: "how-to-apologzize"\ndate: Aug 6, 2021\n---\n\n- **Tags:**\n- **Relevant Notes**\n	- [leadership](moc/leadership.md)\n	- [learning-thinking-communicating](moc/learning-thinking-communicating.md)\n\n\n## Notes\n- **Apologizing to a colleague**\n	- Make it personal: Private \u003e public\n	- Just admit the mistake, don\'t try to defend yourself/ make yourself look better\n	- **Formula**\n		1.

I was the bridegroom, taking the world into my arms.When it\'s over, I don\'t want to wonder if I have made of my life something particular, and real. I don\'t want to find myself sighing and frightened, or full of argument. I don\'t want to end up simply having visited this world." –– [When Death Comes](http://www.phys.unm.edu/~tw/fas/yits/archive/oliver_whendeathcomes.html)\n	- "The biggest failure of the human mind is the inability to understand its full function.\n- **On enduring suffering**\n	- "Life will break you. Nobody can protect you from that, and living alone won\'t either, for solitude will also break you with its yearning. You have to love. You have to feel. It is the reason you are here on earth. You are here to risk your heart. You are here to be swallowed up. And when it happens that you are broken, or betrayed, or left, or hurt, or death brushes near, let yourself sit by an apple tree and listen to the apples falling all around you in heaps, wasting their sweetness. Tell yourself you tasted as many as you could."\n\n## Concepts\n- [Memento mori](moc/philosophy/stoicism/memento.md)',title:"What to answer to 'mamamatay rin tayong lahat'"},"/notes/marketing-analytics":{content:"---\ntitle: \"Marketing analytics\"\ndate: Aug 18, 2021\n---\n\n- **Tags:**\n- **Relevant Notes**\n\n\n## Notes\n\n## Literature Notes\n- [#3: Neil \u0026 Eric's Favorite Marketing Tools - Marketing School - Digital Marketing and Online Marketing Tips | Podcast on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7nHS4rG6n2LNUjZKiOF9cj?si=iuqjh8kFQ-uriaRLjwcI5g\u0026dl_branch=1)[^1]\n	- Analytics\n		- You need at least 6 months to generate quality organic traffic\n		- [What works for Facebook does not work for organic](notes/facebook-v-organic.md)== #come-back \n	- Google search console\n	- AHREFS\n		- Highlights backlinks, backlinks lost, and links of competitors\n		- Know about what your competitors are ranking for\n	- SEMRush\n	- Crazy egg\n	- Hellobar\n\n[^1]: [#3: Neil \u0026 Eric's Favorite Marketing Tools - Marketing School - Digital Marketing and Online Marketing Tips | Podcast on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7nHS4rG6n2LNUjZKiOF9cj?si=iuqjh8kFQ-uriaRLjwcI5g\u0026dl_branch=1)",title:"Marketing analytics"},"/notes/marketing-campaign-tracking":{content:'---\ntitle: "Marketing campaign tracking"\ndate: Aug 19, 2021\n---\n\n- **Tags:** #come-back \n- **Relevant Notes**\n\n## Sources\n- [Marketing Campaign Tracking Template](https://www.airtable.com/templates/marketing/expNoL0sYUbOogSCm/marketing-campaign-tracking)\n## Notes\n\n## Highlights',title:"Marketing campaign tracking"},"/notes/marketing-campaigns":{content:'---\ntitle: "Marketing campaigns"\ndate: Aug 19, 2021\n---\n\n- [Marketing campaign tracking](notes/marketing-campaign-tracking.md)',title:"Marketing campaigns"},"/notes/marketing-case-study-notes":{content:'---\ntitle: "Marketing case study notes"\ndate: Aug 19, 2021\n---\n\nNote: Convert the permanent notes in key takeaways to readable permanent notes\n\n[How I\'d Grow Plausible by Zero to Marketing](https://www.zerotomarketing.com/newsletter/how-id-grow-plausible)\n- Key takeaways\n	- On SEO \u0026 selling points\n			- Frame your [value proposition](notes/value-proposition.md) based on what users find most appealing (via looking at testimonial) and [search engine analytics](notes/marketing-analytics.md)\n	- On content\n			- Choose relevant [blog posts](notes/blog-posts.md) with "selling names" that would direct search\n	- On social media\n			- [Pick your platforms depending on your customer characteristics](notes/marketing/social-media-platforms.md)\n	- On strategies\n			- Explore [referral programs](notes/referral-programs.md)\n- Highlights\n	- free plan with a referral program\n	- Twitter because it’s where their potential customers hang out\n	- All of them should be aimed at Plausible’s audience of potential customers.; The goal of a good content marketing strategy is to intercept an audience that is not aware that your product exists, and make them aware.; Keyword example: GDPR analytics\n	- many unrelated blog posts.\n	- “open source analytics"?

This makes the speech a lot more engaging and means I avoid going into British Airways mode.[^2]\n-  Speeches don't need to be formal. Audiences care most about having fun which means a speech with some banter, humour, and storytelling is going to be a lot more engaging that one without these things.[^3]\n- [How To Improve Public Speaking Skills - Google Digital Garage](https://learndigital.withgoogle.com/digitalgarage/course/public-speaking)[^4]\n	- **1 - Define the objective**\n		- Think of:\n		- Who?\n			- Consider knowledge level\n			- Who are you giving the speech to\n		- How?\n			- Setting\n				- F2F?\n			- Equipment\n				- Microphone - Handheld?\n			- Slides\n				- Remote control?

These differences do not appear to result from gender differences in preferences, but rather from a shared understanding that women will volunteer more than men.\n	- While our results are disconcerting, they also provide a silver lining in suggesting how employees and managers can reduce the inequity in work tasks. The solution is not for women to decline more work requests — which would present problems for organizations and hold repercussions for women — but **instead for management to find ways to distribute tasks more equitably.** Rather than asking for volunteers or asking women to volunteer because they are likely to say yes, managers could consider rotating assignments across employees, for example. Understanding that women volunteer more simply because men are reluctant to do so should also lead men to volunteer more themselves and should empower women to demand fairer treatment.\n	- **If this burden falls disproportionately on women, not only is their advancement stymied, but also corporations miss out on capturing valuable talent.**\n\n[^1]: [Why Women Volunteer for Tasks That Don’t Lead to Promotions](https://hbr.org/2018/07/why-women-volunteer-for-tasks-that-dont-lead-to-promotions)',title:"Untitled Page"},"/notes/write-better-sentences":{content:'---\ntitle: "How to write better sentences"\ndate: Aug 11, 2021\nnotoc: true\n---\n\n- **Tags:** #permanent-notes \n- **Relevant Notes**\n\n\n## Notes\n- Be creative in writing. Play with the emotions of the readers such as fear, surprise, or their senses. There are different techniques you can try:\n	1. Add in a sensory flair to you writing. Keenly describe the scenario with different sentences.\n	2. You can break some writing rules in a sentence.\n	3. Build tension and suspense. You can use one-liners or intense cliffhangers.\n	4. You can make writing that severely precise in quick succession.\n	5. You can end the sentence with a sudden surprise.\n\n## Highlights\n- 11 Favorite Sentences (and What They Teach Us About Good Writing[^1]\n	- A good sentence is an adventure. As the sentences above show, there’s not just one way to write a good sentence. A good sentence can be long or short, and it can even be broken. There’s rhythm, sensory appeal, and poetry—even in prose.\n	- On sentences\n		- Sensory appeal\n			- Sitting here now by the open window, a glissando of birdsong on the very lightest of breezes that carries with it the scent of a final incoming summer, I cling to poetry as I cling to life.\n			- In one sentence, Myers describes a visual detail (an open window), an auditory detail (a glissando of birdsong), a scent (the scent of a final incoming summer), and a sense of motion or touch (the lightest breeze). These sensory descriptions transport readers, letting them experience the story as if they’re there.\n	- A journey in one sentence\n	- The broken beauty\n		- A good sentence can be “broken.” Not every sentence needs a subject and a verb.\n	- The suspense\n	- The cliff edge\n	- Precision\n		- This sentence contains a lot of detail in quick succession.\n	- The surprise\n	- The question\n\n\n[^1]: [11 Sentence Examples: Why Are These Sentences So Good?](https://www.enchantingmarketing.com/sentence-examples/)',title:"How to write better sentences"},"/notes/writing-for-marketers":{content:'---\ntitle: "Writing for marketers"\ndate: Aug 19, 2021\n---\n\n- **Tags:**\n- **Relevant Notes**\n	- [writing](moc/writing.md)\n\n## Sources\n- [Power Words | Fomo - Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CQtH_Okw5jvqKg1E4ftDs0RMfwILxn8AhGYU8pywTIM/edit#gid=2074100514)\n## Notes\n\n## Highlights',title:"Writing for marketers"},"/notes/yerkes-dodson-law":{content:"---\ntitle: \"Yerkes-Dodson-law\"\ndate: Aug 23, 2021\n---\n\n- **Tags:**\n- **Relevant Notes**\n	- [Burnout](notes/burnout.md)\n- **References**\n	- [Yerkes - Dodson Law - Psychestudy](https://www.psychestudy.com/general/motivation-emotion/yerkes-dodson-law)\n	- [Episode 3: Burnout in Online Classes - Psych Speaks: A Mental Health Podcast Series | Podcast on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lifqJhKc1zLX8EZbN2HIL?si=e35e298441fc4bc0)\n\n\n## Notes\n![yerkes](/photos/yerkes.png)\n- Stress is something that we need at optimal amounts. It helps us keep going and improve. However, it is best to keep this at an optimal level wherein you are not compromising yourself.\n- There are three levels of arousal as stated: low level (not alert), optimum level, and high level (associated with panic, anxiety, lower concentration). If you're at the low level, you won't really improve. The optimum level is a sweet spot.\n\n## Highlights",title:"Yerkes-Dodson-law"},"/notes/zettelkasten":{content:"---\ntitle: \"Zettelkasten\"\ndate: Aug 5, 2021\n---\n\n- **Tags:** #come-back \n- **Relevant Notes**\n\n\n## Notes\n- [Don't fall into the collector's fallacy](notes/collector-fallacy.md)\n\n## Highlights",title:"Zettelkasten"},"/private/tag-view/come-back":{content:'---\ntitle: "#come-back"\nnotoc: true\n---\n\n\u003e ⏪ For the notes I need to come back to\n\n```query\ntag: come-back\n```',title:"#come-back"},"/private/tag-view/extra-push":{content:'---\ntitle: "#extra-push"\nnotoc: true\n---\n\n\u003e 💖 For the notes I want to read when I need an extra push\n\n```query\ntag: extra-push\n```',title:"#extra-push"},"/private/tag-view/ideas":{content:'---\ntitle: "#ideas"\nnotoc: true\n---\n\n\u003e 💡 For the ideas I want to develop\n\n```query\ntag: ideas\n```',title:"#ideas"},"/private/tag-view/in-progress":{content:'---\ntitle: "#in-progress"\nnotoc: true\n---\n\n\u003e 👷‍♀️ For the notes I\'m still writing/ transferring\n\n```query\ntag: in-progress\n```',title:"#in-progress"},"/private/tag-view/might-publish":{content:'---\ntitle: "#might-publish"\nnotoc: true\n---\n\n\u003e 🤔 For the notes I\'m still contemplating if I should publish on my blog\n\n```query\ntag: might-publish\n```',title:"#might-publish"},"/private/tag-view/personal-learnings":{content:'---\ntitle: "#personal-learnings"\nnotoc: true\n---\n\n\u003e 🤩 For the notes I personally learned along the way\n\n```query\ntag: personal-learnings\n```',title:"#personal-learnings"},"/private/tag-view/philo":{content:'---\ntitle: "#philosophy"\nnotoc: true\n---\n\n\u003e 💭 For the notes related to philosophy\n\n```query\ntag: philosophy\n```',title:"#philosophy"},"/private/tag-view/pondering":{content:'---\ntitle: "#pondering"\nnotoc: true\n---\n\n\u003e 🙇‍♀️ For the notes I\'m still trying to take a stand on and want to mind bump\n\n```query\ncontent:"pondering"\n```\n\n',title:"#pondering"},"/private/tag-view/published":{content:'---\ntitle: "#published"\nnotoc: true\n---\n\n\u003e 👩‍💻 For the notes I published on my blog\n\n```query\ntag: published\n```',title:"#published"},"/private/tag-view/read-queue":{content:'---\ntitle: "#read-queue"\nnotoc: true\n---\n\n\u003e 📚 For the notes I want to read soon\n\n```query\ntag: read-queue\n```',title:"#read-queue"},"/private/tag-view/repository":{content:'---\nTitle: "#repository"\nnotoc: true\n---\n\n\u003e 🐶 For the notes where I dump out sources and materials\n\n\n```query\ntag: repository\n```',title:"Untitled Page"},"/private/tag-view/to-imprint":{content:'---\ntitle: "#come-back"\nnotoc: true\n---\n\n\u003e ⏪ For the notes I need to come back to\n\n```query\ntag: to-imprint\n```',title:"#come-back"},"/private/tag-view/writing-prompt":{content:'---\ntitle: "#writing-prompt"\nnotoc: true\n---\n\n\u003e ✍️ For the notes I want to write about\n\n```query\ntag: "writing-prompt"\n```',title:"#writing-prompt"},"/projects/embrace-mediocrity":{content:'---\ntitle: "We should learn to embrace mediocrity"\n---\n\n\u003e **Date:** 08052021\n\n- **Tags:** #in-progress/garden #projects\n- **Relevant Notes**\n	- [202108031836](chloe-lyt/030%20Private/032%20Zettelkasten/202108031836.md)\n\n## Grounding\n- **Why?**\n	- To break the construct that we should work our ass off in order to achieve societal acceptance\n	- To break the social construct that settling is incorrect\n	- To impart the concept the it\'s okay to be mediocre\n	- To advocate for prioritizing health over outward sense-seeking\n- **How?**\n	- Share about current societal standards and how it does more harm than good\n	- Expose problem of hustle culture\n	- Current rates of mental health conditions in PH, especially in working age (if the statistics of this exists!)\n	- Rates of job unsatisfaction\n- **Using what?**\n	- Facts + empathy-based approach + connecting through an audience perspecitve: "Where else does this fit in a person\'s daily life?"\n\n\n## Pop-up ideas lol\n- We succumb ourselves to the relentless pressure of society to live our lives in a performative manner–vulnerability is equivalent to weakness, failure is equivalent to, and rest is seen as luxury.

Such a statement embodies its opposite: ==“the worse off you—and your family—are, the more likely you will do poorly in school and mathematics”.== ==Studies defining socio-economic status (SES) and showing its relation to school performance== emerged at the beginning of the 20th century.\n- At a general educational level, the relationship between socioeconomic factors and school achievement is inserted in the ==history of expansion of mass education systems and differential access to education around the world== during the 20th century.\n- Prior to the existence of international comparable, standardized national data sets, the variable of ==socioeconomic status has been one of the most used in the studies.== Since its construction in the 1920s, the measurement has been composed by a series of reliable indicators—parents’ educational level, family income, possession of appliances, possession of books, etc.—which have not changed much in almost 100 years. [[imc-proof]]\n- For example, ==low achievement in mathematics in certain regions in China is explained by the intersection of rurality, parents’ educational level, mother-at-work, and language== (Hu and Du 2009).\n- There is an over-representation of research reports addressing the socioeconomic influences on mathematical achievement in English speaking countries (USA, UK, Australia and New Zealand), while there is little research on this matter in many other places in the world. Such difference may not only be due to the extent of research in mathematics education in these countries, but also to the fact that differential achievement has not been construed as a problem. In East Asia there is little research in mathematics education investigating those who do not perform highly and why. ==In Taiwan research discards the focus on socio-economic variables and privileges variables such as student’s learning goal orientation== (Lin et al. 2009).\n- ==Poverty, rurality, ethnicity, gender, language, culture, race, among others, have been defined as the variables that constitute socioeconomic influences on mathematical achievement.==\n- There have been recent reports that consider race, class, gender, ethnicity, and language proficiency in relation to mathematics education (e.g., Strutchens and Silver 2000; Tate 1997). ==They support the intuitive finding that higher socioeconomic status is associated with increased course-taking and higher achievement on various measures of mathematics achievement.==\n- ==One can claim that it is an important aim for mathematics education to help to establish possibilities within the horizon of students’ foregrounds (Skovsmose 2005).== To make them recognise that: This could also be for me!\n\n[Teachers’ Perception of Social Justice in Mathematics Classrooms](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED573753.pdf)\n- Social justice has been one of the major issues in education in general and mathematics education in particular. What mathematics is taught in the classroom? Whose mathematics is taught? Who teaches mathematics and to whom? How do teachers teach the subject in the classroom? What context teachers use in teaching mathematics? How do students participate in learning mathematics? How do parents support their children in learning mathematics? ==How does school system maintain access to the resources for students? Do all students have access to resources to learn mathematics? Does education policy support equitable mathematics education for all students? How does power and politics play a role in supporting or hindering students’ empowerment through learning of mathematics?== These questions and others have been the major concerns of mathematics education community in recent years. This paper is developed around these questions. Now what follows in this paper are - theoretical foundation of social justice in mathematics classroom, research method, findings and discussion, and implication of the study. \n- ==In the cultural context of the United States, male children and female children, working-class children and middle-class children, black children and white children often do not have equally enabling educational opportunities even when an equivalent amount of resources has been devoted to their education. (p. 26)== [[imc-question]]\n- ==There was a low performance of the students in the public schools than the students of private schools in mathematics and other subjects== (MOE, 2015).\n- Frankenstein’s (2006) conception of ‘critical mathematical literacy’ expands besides the evolution of numeracy to transforming learners' consciousness to social and political matter of knowing mathematics and to the improvement of a sense of working ability. ==The learner’s consciousness toward their personal and social identity can help them position themselves within a learning environment with informed choice to be a part of multicultural milieu.

What aspect of education?\n    - While I do believe that each subject has their own contribution to one's future, I'd like to narrow down our discussion to Mathematics.\n      - Okay, so what about Math?\n      - Interestingly, studies also show the same thing.\n        - (Insert studies of how mathematics affect circumstance here)\n      - But why is Math so importance?\n        - Numbers came before letters\n  - If someone asks me what my favorite subject is, as a self-proclaimed learning enthusiast, I could always answer many things—but Math just isn’t one of them. In all honesty, I find peace in the fact that the closest Math-related thing we do in our course is related to memorizing the degrees of gait.\n  - ==Reveals that mathematics is integral in almost everything that we do.

Fascism? Oppression? Censorship?\n- How many five-year-olds can count?\n- Is math economic?\n\n**Foreword**\n\n_**Circa 2006**_–When I was 5 years old, while I was on the way home from a _sari-sari store_ one-minute away from my house, I have a replaying memory of how I was counting the change I received the store. I can't recall exactly, but I think I bought the piso per piece candy.\n\nWhat I do vividly remember is that I felt annoyed then because the _tindera_ gave me an _oozing-from-my-hands_ sized heaps of 10 cents and 25 cents. Burdened by the heaviness (and as a naive 5 year old), when I passed by the basketball court and came across the area where tall grass covers the ground, I threw away all the coins leaving none behind. Feeling happier, I opened my candy and went back home, pocket empty and mind infused with sweets.\n\nFast forward to 2021, I still think of how much money that was and how much candy I could have bought with that money. In a population of over 7 billion, I'm just one of many, and truth be told, I'm sure that this behavior is something not only I, but many people display. May it not be a literal form of throwing away money, it may be in the form of wasting money on menial pleasures and impulsive purchases–there's that side of society provided the privilege in doing so.\n\nThe sterling fact remains–**we were afforded the privilege in doing so**—while many have to scrap for the money I just tossed away.\n\nI've had conversations about privilege with my friends for multiple times. I honestly still struggle to completely wrap my head at the reality that _poverty is real_. I only started to realize this when I entered a state university in senior high.\n\nApparently, at the other side of the spectrum from those who can impulse buy Shopee finds are people who scrap away at every coin that they see–those who cannot throw away every single coin that they have.\n\nIt is evident that in the world exists a class divide wherein those who are in the upper class are afforded the privilege to exist in that bubble whereas those outside that remain in their circle. Clearly, there is an apparent classist system.\n\nThe question then is–why? Is it by choice? By laziness (as a detached privileged person would post online _\"You are rich because you are lazy!\"_)?\n\nIn this paper, I argue that the underlying reasons behind the classism is a lack of support in education–specifically, mathematics. Through this manuscript, I hope to unveil the interplays of mathematics and classism–that issues in both exist in a cause-effect spectrum ultimately predefining a person's faith.\n\n**Current Status Quo**\n\n\u003e 16.6% people live below the poverty line.[^2]\n\u003e 6% of Filipino students can apply basic mathematical knowledge in simple situations. [^4]\n\u003e 1% of Filipino students can apply conceptual understanding to solve problems. [^4]\n\u003e 6 out of 10 families are deprived of basic education.[^5]\n\u003e 23.9% are multi-dimensionally deprived.[^5]\n\nFirst off, I honestly have a love-hate relationship with statistics. While, yes, we learn about things in quantitative and tangible manners, I hate how we use it to reduce people to mere numbers.\n\nThe statistics as written above show one aspect of our current status quo: many are deprived of education and many live below the poverty line. Sadly, this is only one of the many problems Philippines faces today–in fact, on top of other problems such as a broken political system or the current pandemic, this drowns in the sea of problems that need to be \"urgently addressed\" but are tucked down.\n\nThat being said, with this problem perpetuating consistently unknowingly with only few granted the privilege of thinking about this problem, how do we solve it?\n\nIn order to answer the question, as an avid believer in approaching problems at the root cause, I first seek to unveil the reasons behind this building on the premise that education and socioeconomic status have a relationship predetermining each other.\n\n**Predetermination of success**\n\nWhat if I told you I can **statistically determine** how likely you are to fail?\n\nAs we grow up, we are told about how education is integral to success, as well as how grit, motivation, and perseverance are important as we try to traverse to life. At the street, this sounds like: _You're lazy? You'll be poor!_\n\nI scavenged through Google about what a successful person has, or what they have that other people don't (Insert photo here). I had one search criteria in mind: Look for the articles that are most **popular, easy to read, and appealing**–or the ones blessed by SEO and traffic. Condensing them, here are  the most recurring themes:\n\n- Be passionate\n- Stay motivated\n- Build yourself forward!\n\nThings I went through:\n\n- [8 Simple Ways to Be Successful—from 8 Inspiring Leaders.](https://ce.uci.edu/careerzot/8-simple-ways-successful-8-inspiring-leaders/)\n- [The Keys to Success - 10 Things You Can Start Doing Now](https://finallyfamilyhomes.org/10-keys-to-success-in-life/)\n- [How to Be Successful in Life [2019] | Brian Tracy](https://www.briantracy.com/blog/personal-success/personal-success-keys-to-success-change-your-life/)\n- [6 Steps for Success in Life](https://www.verywellmind.com/how-to-be-successful-in-life-4165743)\n- [How to Be Successful (And Get Everything You Want in Life)](https://www.oberlo.com.ph/blog/how-to-be-successful)\n\nApparently, all of these focused solely on the **motivation/ character** aspect of what it takes someone to be successful–which is honestly, a very shallow view. I strongly believe that the total consideration of character is incomplete. To delve deeper into this, as a health student, I would like to reference the [social determinants of health](https://www.who.int/sdhconference/resources/ConceptualframeworkforactiononSDH_eng.pdf)–essentially, health does not exist in a vacuum–it is the culmination of multiple factors affecting one's health.[^1]\n\n\n\u003e If we consider this fact, we can then infer that **one's conditions are not isolated yes-no relationships determined by one thing (not character especially!)*; rather, they are formed out of multiple atomic factors culminating into one's circumstance.\n\nBuilding on my introduction, let's derive our own success rate equation. *(Note: Most definitely not an accurate one).*\n\nIn order to do this, I'd like to look into two contexts:\n\n1. **What a person is born with** (Innate factors)\n2. **What a person is subjected to** (External factors)\n\nLet's piece this one by one.\n\nWhen we are born, we have the following absolute things: **sex** and **parents**. An important thing to note is that our parents by default determine our socioeconomic status. In mathematical notation, this would look like the following:\n\n$innate factors=sex+socioeconomic status$\n\nThat being said, in this consideration, socioeconomic status itself can serve as headsign with \"I will be around 50% successful in relationship to Elon Musk.\"\n\nOf course, socioeconomic status is comprised of too many things. Then, if we add in factors for luck, we can get\n\n$innate factors=sex+socioeconomic status$\n\n$success = (sex)(socioeconomic status)(luck)(character)$\n\n\u003e If socioeconomic status hence serves as such an integral factor\n\nIn addition, one interesting fact I'd like to point out is that studies show that Filipinos are determined to achieve the bare minimum to be renumerated.[^3] I have yet to find the reason as to why, but I believe it can be attributed\n\n**Math**\n- ==Poverty, rurality, ethnicity, gender, language, culture, race, among others, have been defined as the variables that constitute socioeconomic influences on mathematical achievement.==[^7]\n-  ==There was a low performance of the students in the public schools than the students of private schools in mathematics and other subjects== (MOE, 2015).[^8]\n\n**Unsorted**\n**Social justice**\nWe give little credit.\n- In East Asia there is little research in mathematics education investigating those who do not perform highly and why. In Taiwan research discards the focus on socio-economic variables and privileges variables such as student’s learning goal orientation (Lin et al. 2009).[^6]\n\nWe unconsiously let a subject gatekeep success for a huge part of our population.\n- ==There have been recent reports that consider race, class, gender, ethnicity, and language proficiency in relation to mathematics education (e.g., Strutchens and Silver 2000; Tate 1997). They support the intuitive finding that higher socioeconomic status is associated with increased course-taking and higher achievement on various measures of mathematics achievement.==\n- ==The learner’s consciousness toward their personal and social identity can help them position themselves within a learning environment with informed choice to be a part of multicultural milieu. In this context, “the objective of critical mathematics ought to be to engage marginalized students in cognitively demanding mathematics in ways that help them succeed in learning.\"==\n\nMath is needed.\n- ==Thus, from the turn of the 19th century to present day, the mathematics curriculum is an important technology that inserts subjects into the forms of thinking and acting needed for people to become the ideal cosmopolitan citizen.==[^6]\n- ==Mathematics for all. That high achievement in mathematics is a desired and growing demand for all citizens is a recent invention of mathematics education research. Between the years of reconstruction after the Second World War and the Cold War, school curricula were modernized with focus on the subject areas for the purpose of securing a qualified elite of college students.==[^6]:\n\nWe live in a system where we statistically let other people fail.\n\nThis is not just a crisis of quality of education. It is a crisis of access first and foremost.\n\n\n\n---\nWorked on Word after",title:"Interplays of Mathematics and Classism – Math 10 2021 Capstone"},"/templates/actual-notes-no-toc":{content:'---\ntitle: "{{title}}"\ndate: {{date:MMM D, YYYY}}\nnotoc: true\n---\n\n- **Tags:**\n- **Relevant Notes**\n\n\n## Notes\n\n## Highlights',title:"{{title}}"},"/templates/actual-notes-with-toc":{content:'---\ntitle: "{{title}}"\ndate: {{date:MMM D, YYYY}}\n---\n\n- **Tags:**\n- **Relevant Notes**\n\n\n## Notes\n\n## Highlights',title:"{{title}}"},"/templates/changelog-temp":{content:'---\ntitle: "Changelog"\ndate: {{date:MMM D, YYYY}}\nnotoc: true\n---\n',title:"Changelog"},"/templates/no-toc":{content:'---\ntitle: "{{title}}"\ndate: {{date:MMM D, YYYY}}\nnotoc: true\n---',title:"{{title}}"},"/templates/toc":{content:'---\ntitle: "{{title}}"\ndate: {{date:MMM D, YYYY}}\n---\n',title:"{{title}}"},"/templates/writing-temp":{content:'---\ntitle: "{{title}}"\ndate: {{date:MMM D, YYYY}}\n---\n\n- **Tags:**\n- **Relevant Notes**\n\n## Grounding\n## Outline\n## Paper',title:"{{title}}"}};for(const[a,b]of Object.entries(scrapedContent))contentIndex.add(a,b.content);const stopwords=['i','me','my','myself','we','our','ours','ourselves','you','your','yours','yourself','yourselves','he','him','his','himself','she','her','hers','herself','it','its','itself','they','them','their','theirs','themselves','what','which','who','whom','this','that','these','those','am','is','are','was','were','be','been','being','have','has','had','having','do','does','did','doing','a','an','the','and','but','if','or','because','as','until','while','of','at','by','for','with','about','against','between','into','through','during','before','after','above','below','to','from','up','down','in','out','on','off','over','under','again','further','then','once','here','there','when','where','why','how','all','any','both','each','few','more','most','other','some','such','no','nor','not','only','own','same','so','than','too','very','s','t','can','will','just','don','should','now'],highlight=(i,j)=>{const a=15,k=j.split(/\s+/).filter(a=>a!==""),b=i.split(/\s+/).filter(a=>a!==""),f=a=>k.some(b=>a.toLowerCase().includes(b.toLowerCase())),d=b.map(f);let e=0,g=0;for(let b=0;b<Math.max(d.length-a,0);b++){const f=d.slice(b,b+a),c=f.reduce((a,b)=>a+b,0);c>e&&(e=c,g=b)}const c=Math.max(g-a,0),h=Math.min(c+2*a,b.length),l=b.slice(c,h).map(a=>{return f(a)?`<span class="search-highlight">${a}</span>`:a}).join(" ").replaceAll('</span> <span class="search-highlight">'," ");return`${c===0?"":"..."}${l}${h===b.length?"":"..."}`},resultToHTML=({url:b,title:c,content:d,term:a})=>{const e=d.split("---")[2],f=removeMarkdown(e),g=highlight(c,a),h=highlight(f,a);return`<div class="result-card" id="${b}">
