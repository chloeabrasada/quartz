# W4 Sensemaking - Getting opinionated
BLANK is a good because...
BLANK is bad because...
BLANK causes...

- [[Wu wei]]
	- Wu wei is good because it allows you to create habits ([Atomic Habits](notes/atomic-habits.md)) that let you reduce friction on other parts of your workflow. This makes me think of how we should be [productive](moc/productivity.md). It is also good because it involves finding your [ikigai](notes/ikigai.md) and just existing.
	- Wu wei is bad because it can let you fall into the trap of stopping to explore.
	- Wu wei causes [self-actualization](notes/self-actualization.md) ([Maslow's hierarchy of needs](notes/maslow-hierarchy.md). It causes falling in love with what you're doing and [ultimate happiness](notes/happines.md).
- Lord of the Rings
- [[Newton’s First Law of Motion]]
	- Netwon's first law of motion is good because it lets you be too comfortable at your current state. Want to watch Netflix all night? Then you need a strong external force to let you do it. I think it's good when you really want to rest because you're burned out.
	- Newton's first law of motion is bad because it makes it hard for you to stand up and move.
	- Newton's first law of motion causes friction in your workflow and productivity in general.
- [[Friendship]]
	- Friendship is good because it lets you constantly grow and have companions you can confide with.
	- Friendship is bad (at times) becauses it teaches someone to be [complacent](notes/complancency.md) when it comes to dealing with their friends. This is especially seen during workplaces. (see: [notes/workplace-culture.md]).
- Future-proof
	- Future-proof is good because it allows you to unlock higher levels of learning and connect everything you learn. It also stops you from forgetting the different things you want to learn about (which is important when you consume a lot of information!) (see: [forgetting-curve](notes/sources/books/book-notes/forgetting-curve)).
	- Future-proof is bad because.. it's not. I don't think there's anything wrong with it.
	- Future-proof causes [self-actualization](notes/self-actualization.md) and lifetime learning! This also lets you have a forever-living [gallery of identity](notes/gallery-of-identity.md) that lets you acknowledge your growth and be keen towards growing more as well! 
- Elon Musk
- shadow
- butterfly
	- Butterfly is good because it is beautiful. They are also a reminder of how we transition into different phases.
	- Butterfly is bad because... it's not. It's absolutely harmless.
	- Butterfly causes additional color in the world!
- saying goodbye
	- Saying goodbye is good because it lets you discover new things and unlocks a lot of new stuff. It lets you see more opportunities, meet new people.
	- Saying goodbye is bad because it's hard to let go of attachment and leave things behind in the past sloely.
	- Saying goodbye causes bittersweet feelings.
- [[bodyweight exercises]]
	- Bodyweight exercises are good because they let you do workouts at any place. There are also multiple varieties. It's also a good way to build fitness without any expense.
	- Bodyweight exercises are bad because there are limitations on the amount of muscle you can build compared to when using machines at gyms.
	- Bodyweight exercises cause fitness!

# Takeaways
- Have an opinion
	- Great way to get us actively thinking. It's a sin to have no opinion.
	- It lets you make an argument–believe it or not.
- Give yourself the liberty, latitude, and slack to say things you don't believe in.
	- It's okay to not be perfect.
	- It's the process we walk the path and we discover more truly what we are after.
- Nothing is cast in concrete. You can expect to re-title often.

> Say things you don't really believe. It will help you deepen your thoughts. It's okay to make mistakes!
