# MATH 10 Capstone
**Working Title:** Interplays of Mathematics and Classism
Midyear 2021

>⭐️ Hello! I'm Chloe. Welcome to my working file of [Interplays of Mathematics and Classism](moc/writing/Interplays%20of%20Mathematics%20and%20Classism.md). This file contains my thought processes involved in writing my capstone divided into three phases–pre-writing, rough writing, and actual writing *(okay, I honestly don't know if there are more technicalities on this)*.

💭 I'm an intuitive thinker, so you can find that most of the notes here are scattered and out of place, but in a sense... organized. Most of my ideas come unsolicited like while I'm in the middle of a workout or clocking in my 10k steps target or while I'm showering, so I always need to have some notepad around me.
🙋 **Why build in public?** We live in a world where we usually only see finished products--the end of a year-long weight loss journey, the end of four years studying, or the end of months cold emailing recruiters to secure a job. It's easy to understand why–it's because 1.) they are the most visible and 2.) we want the world to see the best parts of us. But I really believe in the power of vulnerability and showcasing your thought processes for authenticity. Plus, I believe it fosters collaboration.
