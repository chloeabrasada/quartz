Early 2021, I journeyed on to integrating stoicism to my life. I think it's a wonderful philosophy that all in all makes life easier. Here are some of my ~~unstoic~~ notes as I was learning about stoicism and continue to build it on today.

Note also that I forgot to list down my resources on everything compiled here (since I had them on early this year)! ðŸ˜ž I'm trying to look for them now!

I regularly updated my [Are.na on Stoicism](https://www.are.na/chloe-abrasada/stoicism-oohd2d9o1wg).
