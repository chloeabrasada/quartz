> I have super scrappy baseline knowledge in code. I only reached up to midway of my FreeCodeCamp journey so I'm.. lost.... and reliant on Google search lol. I'm documenting my journey here at [Building this website.](home/building-this-website.md)

## Currently...
- Fixing the broken links
- Fixing the notes tagged #in-progress/garden *(also will I ever lol)*
- Concretizing my system üçÉ
- Revisiting my old notes in Notion, Notes, Mem, Telegram, Messenger, Discord, etc. I really wish I learned about Obsidian earlier grr.
- Thinking of how to integrate company departments? Lol

**One of many note repositories lol**
