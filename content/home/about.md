> 👋 Hello! I'm Chloe Abrasada. I actually have a second name that I don't use for branding purposes *(jkjk)*. I'm a productivity nerd 👩‍🏫, web lurker 💻, and design enthusiast 🎨.

📚 I'm currently studying Occupational therapy in UP Manila. Alongside that, I'm a UX designer currently working with different start-ups (diverse fields, yes!). I also advocate for mental health and sustainability and am passionate about volunteering.

## 🧠
My thinking is shaped by the lovely programs I've personally grown my knowledge with.
- Reshaped my relationship with knowledge as a [Linking Your Thinking](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/) scholar
- Questioned my assumptions on technology, creativity, and design as a [Developh](https://developh.org/) Camp fellow
- Defining (currently!) my principles as a [OpenPrinciples](https://openprinciples.org/) fellow

## 🍉 Luvs...

🥳 I'm in love with learning, building, and creating! So I pretty much *can* get interested at anything, but here are some of the things that really pique my interest:

- I like learning about health in general! I've been a health nut (I don't drink carbonated drinks lol) for a huge part of my life and have been working out consistently since the start of 2021 after *yeeeeaaaarsss* of having month-long exercise stints.
- Mental health! I started my advocacy journey back in 2018, and it has been a huge part of who I am.
- Productivity! I'm a tool & tip hoarder. Most of my notes are still scattered everywhere since I jump through tools and scavenge a lot of things.
- ✨ Design ✨
- Philosophy! I try to practice [stoicism](moc/stoicism.md) and am trying to transition into practicing it more. Since I started in 2021, I also journal daily, reflect monthly, and have an annual year-round up!
- Psychology! One of my goals is to read this huge repository of psychology books.. but I haven't found the luxury to do so yet. 💭 I like [personality tests](notes/personality-tests.md) and [self-awareness.](notes/self-awareness.md)
- Anything related to personal development! I'm trying to get into reading more non-fiction books this year. I recently read [Atomic Habits by James Clear](notes/sources/books/atomic-habits.md). I'm also subscribed to a loooot of [newsletters](notes/sources/newsletters.md) and make time to read them.
- Leadership and facilitation 👥
- Music 🎧 I have over a hundred playlists on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/chloeabrasada) and am constantly on the lookout for good finds. I'm also a bathroom singer and frustrated guitarist/ pianist. I sometimes post in [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/chloeabrasada) lol.
- Sitcoms! When I'm too tired to do anythiiing, I like spending my time watching lighthearted shows for the sake of just smiling.
- Dogs... 🐶
- Tea lol. I like green tea & chai. 🍵 Also, tea > coffee.
