## Research Document

[PH's Grade 4 students lowest in math, science around the world -- int'l study | Inquirer News](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1370289/phs-grade-4-students-lowest-in-math-science-around-the-world-study)
- ==Only one percent reached the high benchmark==, meaning, “students can apply conceptual understanding to solve problems.”
- In 2019, Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) found that ==Filipinos fared worst among 79 countries in reading literacy and second-lowest in both mathematical and scientific literacy.==
- ==“I call this a major crisis in the education of the country,” he said.==
- “We have to address this crisis and we cannot just sleep quietly and comfortably knowing that our students are performing very poorly and continue to perform poorly in a lot of the examination,” he added.


[The Biggest Failure of Math Education: Enabling Elitism and Classism | by Sunil Singh | Medium](https://sunilsingh-42118.medium.com/the-biggest-failure-of-math-education-enabling-elitism-and-classism-b7e7e23938c8)
- ==Make your daughter practice math, she'll thank you later==
- That the article ==reinforces the status afforded to learning mathematics, while being completely oblivious that this call for daughters to practice more mathematics seems to be directed at daughters you might find on Nickelodeon television shows.==

[Socioeconomic Influence on Mathematical Achievement: What Is Visible and What Is Neglected | SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-12688-3_19)
- ==It is known that socioeconomic factors have an influence on mathematical achievement.== Nowadays such link has become a “fact” that researchers, teachers, administrators and politicians have at hand: “the better off you—and your family—are, the more likely you will do well in school, including mathematics”. Such a statement embodies its opposite: ==“the worse off you—and your family—are, the more likely you will do poorly in school and mathematics”.== ==Studies defining socio-economic status (SES) and showing its relation to school performance== emerged at the beginning of the 20th century.
- At a general educational level, the relationship between socioeconomic factors and school achievement is inserted in the ==history of expansion of mass education systems and differential access to education around the world== during the 20th century.
- Prior to the existence of international comparable, standardized national data sets, the variable of ==socioeconomic status has been one of the most used in the studies.== Since its construction in the 1920s, the measurement has been composed by a series of reliable indicators—parents’ educational level, family income, possession of appliances, possession of books, etc.—which have not changed much in almost 100 years. [[imc-proof]]
- For example, ==low achievement in mathematics in certain regions in China is explained by the intersection of rurality, parents’ educational level, mother-at-work, and language== (Hu and Du 2009).
- There is an over-representation of research reports addressing the socioeconomic influences on mathematical achievement in English speaking countries (USA, UK, Australia and New Zealand), while there is little research on this matter in many other places in the world. Such difference may not only be due to the extent of research in mathematics education in these countries, but also to the fact that differential achievement has not been construed as a problem. In East Asia there is little research in mathematics education investigating those who do not perform highly and why. ==In Taiwan research discards the focus on socio-economic variables and privileges variables such as student’s learning goal orientation== (Lin et al. 2009).
- ==Poverty, rurality, ethnicity, gender, language, culture, race, among others, have been defined as the variables that constitute socioeconomic influences on mathematical achievement.==
- There have been recent reports that consider race, class, gender, ethnicity, and language proficiency in relation to mathematics education (e.g., Strutchens and Silver 2000; Tate 1997). ==They support the intuitive finding that higher socioeconomic status is associated with increased course-taking and higher achievement on various measures of mathematics achievement.==
- ==One can claim that it is an important aim for mathematics education to help to establish possibilities within the horizon of students’ foregrounds (Skovsmose 2005).== To make them recognise that: This could also be for me!

[Teachers’ Perception of Social Justice in Mathematics Classrooms](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED573753.pdf)
- Social justice has been one of the major issues in education in general and mathematics education in particular. What mathematics is taught in the classroom? Whose mathematics is taught? Who teaches mathematics and to whom? How do teachers teach the subject in the classroom? What context teachers use in teaching mathematics? How do students participate in learning mathematics? How do parents support their children in learning mathematics? ==How does school system maintain access to the resources for students? Do all students have access to resources to learn mathematics? Does education policy support equitable mathematics education for all students? How does power and politics play a role in supporting or hindering students’ empowerment through learning of mathematics?== These questions and others have been the major concerns of mathematics education community in recent years. This paper is developed around these questions. Now what follows in this paper are - theoretical foundation of social justice in mathematics classroom, research method, findings and discussion, and implication of the study. 
- ==In the cultural context of the United States, male children and female children, working-class children and middle-class children, black children and white children often do not have equally enabling educational opportunities even when an equivalent amount of resources has been devoted to their education. (p. 26)== [[imc-question]]
- ==There was a low performance of the students in the public schools than the students of private schools in mathematics and other subjects== (MOE, 2015).
- Frankenstein’s (2006) conception of ‘critical mathematical literacy’ expands besides the evolution of numeracy to transforming learners' consciousness to social and political matter of knowing mathematics and to the improvement of a sense of working ability. ==The learner’s consciousness toward their personal and social identity can help them position themselves within a learning environment with informed choice to be a part of multicultural milieu. In this context, “the objective of critical mathematics ought to be to engage marginalized students in cognitively demanding mathematics in ways that help them succeed in learning."== [[imc-important]]

  - If someone asks me what my favorite subject is, as a self-proclaimed learning enthusiast, I could always answer many things—but Math just isn’t one of them.

  - ==Reveals that mathematics is integral in almost everything that we do.

# Foreword

_**Circa 2006**_–When I was 5 years old, while I was on the way home from a _sari-sari store_ one-minute away from my house, I have a replaying memory of how I was counting the change I received the store. I can't recall exactly, but I think I bought the piso per piece candy.

What I do vividly remember is that I felt annoyed then because the _tindera_ gave me an _oozing-from-my-hands_ sized heaps of 10 cents and 25 cents. Burdened by the heaviness (and as a naive 5 year old), when I passed by the basketball court and came across the area where tall grass covers the ground, I threw away all the coins leaving none behind. Feeling happier, I opened my candy and went back home, pocket empty and mind infused with sweets.

Fast forward to 2021, I still think of how much money that was and how much candy I could have bought with that money. In a population of over 7 billion, I'm just one of many, and truth be told, I'm sure that this behavior is something not only I, but many people display. May it not be a literal form of throwing away money, it may be in the form of wasting money on menial pleasures and impulsive purchases–there's that side of society provided the privilege in doing so.

The sterling fact remains–**we were afforded the privilege in doing so**—while many have to scrap for the money I just tossed away.

I've had conversations about privilege with my friends for multiple times. I honestly still struggle to completely wrap my head at the reality that _poverty is real_. I only started to realize this when I entered a state university in senior high.

Apparently, at the other side of the spectrum from those who can impulse buy Shopee finds are people who scrap away at every coin that they see–those who cannot throw away every single coin that they have.

It is evident that in the world exists a class divide wherein those who are in the upper class are afforded the privilege to exist in that bubble whereas those outside that remain in their circle. Clearly, there is an apparent classist system.

The question then is–why? Is it by choice? By laziness (as a detached privileged person would post online _"You are rich because you are lazy!"_)?

In this paper, I argue that the underlying reasons behind the classism is a lack of support in education–specifically, mathematics. Through this manuscript, I hope to unveil the interplays of mathematics and classism–that issues in both exist in a cause-effect spectrum ultimately predefining a person's faith.

# Current Status Quo

> 16.6% people live below the poverty line.[^2]
> 6% of Filipino students can apply basic mathematical knowledge in simple situations. [^4]
> 1% of Filipino students can apply conceptual understanding to solve problems. [^4]
> 6 out of 10 families are deprived of basic education.[^5]
> 23.9% are multi-dimensionally deprived.[^5]

First off, I honestly have a love-hate relationship with statistics. While, yes, we learn about things in quantitative and tangible manners, I hate how we use it to reduce people to mere numbers.

The statistics as written above show one aspect of our current status quo: many are deprived of education and many live below the poverty line. Sadly, this is only one of the many problems Philippines faces today–in fact, on top of other problems such as a broken political system or the current pandemic, this drowns in the sea of problems that need to be "urgently addressed" but are tucked down.

That being said, with this problem perpetuating consistently unknowingly with only few granted the privilege of thinking about this problem, how do we solve it?

In order to answer the question, as an avid believer in approaching problems at the root cause, I first seek to unveil the reasons behind this building on the premise that education and socioeconomic status have a relationship predetermining each other.

# Predetermination of success

What if I told you I can **statistically determine** how likely you are to fail?

As we grow up, we are told about how education is integral to success, as well as how grit, motivation, and perseverance are important as we try to traverse to life. At the street, this sounds like: _You're lazy? You'll be poor!_

I scavenged through Google about what a successful person has, or what they have that other people don't (Insert photo here). I had one search criteria in mind: Look for the articles that are most **popular, easy to read, and appealing**–or the ones blessed by SEO and traffic. Condensing them, here are  the most recurring themes:

- Be passionate
- Stay motivated
- Build yourself forward!

Things I went through:

- [8 Simple Ways to Be Successful—from 8 Inspiring Leaders.](https://ce.uci.edu/careerzot/8-simple-ways-successful-8-inspiring-leaders/)
- [The Keys to Success - 10 Things You Can Start Doing Now](https://finallyfamilyhomes.org/10-keys-to-success-in-life/)
- [How to Be Successful in Life [2019] | Brian Tracy](https://www.briantracy.com/blog/personal-success/personal-success-keys-to-success-change-your-life/)
- [6 Steps for Success in Life](https://www.verywellmind.com/how-to-be-successful-in-life-4165743)
- [How to Be Successful (And Get Everything You Want in Life)](https://www.oberlo.com.ph/blog/how-to-be-successful)

Apparently, all of these focused solely on the **motivation/ character** aspect of what it takes someone to be successful–which is honestly, a very shallow view. I strongly believe that the total consideration of character is incomplete. To delve deeper into this, as a health student, I would like to reference the [social determinants of health](https://www.who.int/sdhconference/resources/ConceptualframeworkforactiononSDH_eng.pdf)–essentially, health does not exist in a vacuum–it is the culmination of multiple factors affecting one's health.[^1]


> If we consider this fact, we can then infer that **one's conditions are not isolated yes-no relationships determined by one thing (not character especially!)*; rather, they are formed out of multiple atomic factors culminating into one's circumstance.

Building on my introduction, let's derive our own success rate equation. *(Note: Most definitely not an accurate one).*

In order to do this, I'd like to look into two contexts:

1. **What a person is born with** (Innate factors)
2. **What a person is subjected to** (External factors)

Let's piece this one by one.

When we are born, we have the following absolute things: **sex** and **parents**. An important thing to note is that our parents by default determine our socioeconomic status. In mathematical notation, this would look like the following:

$innate factors=sex+socioeconomic status$

That being said, in this consideration, socioeconomic status itself can serve as headsign with "I will be around 50% successful in relationship to Elon Musk."

Of course, socioeconomic status is comprised of too many things. Then, if we add in factors for luck, we can get

$innate factors=sex+socioeconomic status$

$success = (sex)(socioeconomic status)(luck)(character)$

> If socioeconomic status hence serves as such an integral factor

In addition, one interesting fact I'd like to point out is that studies show that Filipinos are determined to achieve the bare minimum to be renumerated.[^3] I have yet to find the reason as to why, but I believe it can be attributed

# Math
- ==Poverty, rurality, ethnicity, gender, language, culture, race, among others, have been defined as the variables that constitute socioeconomic influences on mathematical achievement.==[^7]
-  ==There was a low performance of the students in the public schools than the students of private schools in mathematics and other subjects== (MOE, 2015).[^8]

# Unsorted
## Social justice
## We give little credit.
- In East Asia there is little research in mathematics education investigating those who do not perform highly and why. In Taiwan research discards the focus on socio-economic variables and privileges variables such as student’s learning goal orientation (Lin et al. 2009).[^6]

## We unconsiously let a subject gatekeep success for a huge part of our population.
- ==There have been recent reports that consider race, class, gender, ethnicity, and language proficiency in relation to mathematics education (e.g., Strutchens and Silver 2000; Tate 1997). They support the intuitive finding that higher socioeconomic status is associated with increased course-taking and higher achievement on various measures of mathematics achievement.==
- ==The learner’s consciousness toward their personal and social identity can help them position themselves within a learning environment with informed choice to be a part of multicultural milieu. In this context, “the objective of critical mathematics ought to be to engage marginalized students in cognitively demanding mathematics in ways that help them succeed in learning."==
### Math is needed.
- ==Thus, from the turn of the 19th century to present day, the mathematics curriculum is an important technology that inserts subjects into the forms of thinking and acting needed for people to become the ideal cosmopolitan citizen.==[^6]
- ==Mathematics for all. That high achievement in mathematics is a desired and growing demand for all citizens is a recent invention of mathematics education research. Between the years of reconstruction after the Second World War and the Cold War, school curricula were modernized with focus on the subject areas for the purpose of securing a qualified elite of college students.==[^6]:

## ==We live in a system where we statistically let other people fail.==
## This is not just a crisis of quality of education. It is a crisis of access first and foremost.
