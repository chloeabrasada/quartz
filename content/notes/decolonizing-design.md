- **Relevant Notes**

## Notes
- Western ideologies have shaped our concepts of "preferable design". Anything outside these Western preferences are seen as different or inferior.
- We should remove the distinction of art and craft.[^2] The concept of a difference between art and craft reflect classist distinctions from the West.

## Highlights
[What Does It Mean to Decolonize Design?](https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/what-does-it-mean-to-decolonize-design/)[^1]
- “Colonization” is rooted in indigenous peoples’ experiences of oppression—specifically, the seizure of native resources, as well as the embedding of Western ideology into society
- The work designers make is inspired by taste, and taste is often derived from what we’re exposed to during our upbringing.
- The authority of the canon has undermined the work produced by non-Western cultures and those from poorer background
- Classifying traditional craft as different from modern design deems the histories and practices of design from many cultures inferior.
- We should aim to eliminate the false distinctions between craft and design, in order to recognize all culturally important forms of making
- “When Western conventions are centred in design, this means that anything else is seen as ‘different.’
- Our reliance on western culture inhibits our ability to incorporate other standards.
- ... decoloniality is about reimagining something beyond the current system we exist in rethinking the needs of the audience you’re designing for
- Accept that social constituencies (not clients but constituencies) have made a choice that should be respected instead of ridiculed […] Challenge yourself to dismantle what the (Ivy League?) man has told you is ugly, uncouth, primitive, savage.”
- But there are certain situations where we cannot begin to identify with the lived experiences of the audience we need to communicate with.
- For far too long, designers have remained married to the concept that what we do is neutral, universal, that politics has no place in design,” says Abdulla. Yet the choices we make as designers are intrinsically political
