## Notes
- Find something that makes you stand out. People want people who are creative.[^1]
	- Give a unique input in ways that people can grow their business. Don't just give something generic like spending more on ads, etc.
	- Ex. Break down why their copy is terrible, show stats of other sites, creative platforms that they are not leveraging yet
- Show that you ==want to get above and beyond.==[^1]
