## Highlights
Thanks or no thanks? Sending a note[^1]
- They suggest:
	- Sending a note.
	- Making it handwritten or digital.
	- Making it personal.
	- Showing that you’re interested in the job.
	- Showing that you paid attention to the conversation.

	- I always send a thank you note/ email and I advise my clients to do so because:
		- It is the polite thing to do.
		- It gives you an opportunity to reiterate some points shared during the interview and the value you bring to the table
		- It shows genuine interest in the position
		- Most people won’t send it, it helps you stand out.
		- Even if you don’t get the job, a memorable thank you note keeps you top of mind and allows you to keep the door open to follow up on other opportunities.

Sometimes, I’ve been on the fence about an interview and a thank-you note has convinced me to push the candidate to the next step.
