	- Survey design principles to keep in mind
		1. Align with your stakeholders

		12. Create space for your customers' voice
		13. Keep respondents informed
		14. Account for order effects
		15. Negativity is stronger
		16. Prediction and recall are not reliable
			- Avoid asking questions that ask your participant to recall something late in the past or predict their future behavior. If you have to ask a question like this, timebox the period. For example, you could ask, ‚ÄúWithin the past week, roughly how many times did you log in to your email account‚Äù? Rather than ‚ÄúHow often do you log in to your email account‚Äù? When questions use language like ‚Äòoften,‚Äô it leaves a lot of room for subjective interpretation about what often actually means.
		17. Ask if you can follow up
		18. Monitor right after launch
		19. Compensate your participants
