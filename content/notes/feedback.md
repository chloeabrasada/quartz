I really value the importance of giving feedback. Our words are too powerful to impart things callously. I've seen people give feedback differently, and I think there's no super perfect formula into giving it because people are so unpredictable and subjective. I adjust my approach, but what I always seek to maintain is to relay feedback in a **constructive manner that helps a person move forward concretely**.

A common argument against taking a very systematic and calculated approach is that we take away the directness of things. However, [directness just isn't an excuse to be an asshole.](notes/perdev/better/directness.md) You can find balance into creating [safe spaces](notes/perdev/mh/safe-spaces.md), [psychological safety](notes/psychological-safety.md), and being candid.

## Guiding Principles
1. Give feedback that is and think-forward.
2. Seek to let people improve.
3. Understand that everyone always has room for improvement!
4. Focus on actions and results.
5. Leave emotions out *(but don't be insensitive!)*.
6. Stay growth-minded! 🍃

## How I Give Feedback
I follow a three step approach into giving feedback. 

1. **Highlight the assets of the work.**
	- I believe the secret into making feedback that sticks and ultimately helps a person move forward is to build the relationship on mutual trust. First focusing on building rapport establishes this and catches a person's attention.
	- How this looks like would be in the following:
		- "I like how you..."
2. **Relay the specific feedback constructively.**
	- Words are powerful. Feedback may either motivate a person to do better or change a person's mindset towards progressing in what they're doing. Constructive criticsm is a manner in which are frank about what we want to criticize and relay it in a manner that is constructive, not destructive.
	- Seek to let the person understand where you're coming from. This doesn't have to be done explicitly
	- Instead of "*This looks terrible...",* say *"This has a lot of room for improvement, and we can work around it!"*
3. **Suggest steps to move forward.**
	- Be action-oriented in the feedback approach. I think concrete steps on how to move forward are better than suddenly taking over and micromanaging something. Letting people facilitate their own growth is a good way through actually doing something to improve promotes good team dynamics.
	- Specific steps also serve as a good jumpstart for people. Stay growth-minded!


When combined, this approach looks like this in a design team example:
> Hi, `Chloe`! I recently came across your `latest pubmat`. I love how you adapted `a new approach into combining the elements, plus your palette!`. However, I think there are still ways in which we can improve the `combination of fonts`. Can you try `Inter/ Montserrat here at this bottom part`? I also suggest `trying out this photo asset at this websitexyz`. Thank you, and I look forward to hearing from you!
