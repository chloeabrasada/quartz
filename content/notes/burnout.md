## Notes
- Burnout has three different dimensions: exhaustion, cynism (apathy & detachment from work), and lack of professional efficacy (a drop in your performance).
- Burnout is not something that should be normalized.
- Compared to [stress](notes/stress.md), burnout does not have any more motivation involved. Stress still induces urgency and lets people keep going. Burnout, on the other hand, involves disengagement.
- In order to avoid burnout, we need individual and collective effort. In the individual level:
	- Learn more about it. Try to understand technicalities, etc.
	- Implement [mindfulness](notes/mindfulness.md)
