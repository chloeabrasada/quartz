**From a YT Comment**
- **Step 1.** Laser focus on what you want and only what you want. Don't talk yourself or allow yourself to be talked out of your desire. Write it down. Don't let yourself get distracted. 
- **Step 2.** Question what you consciously and unconsciously believe about your desire. Limiting beliefs prevent us from getting what we desire. Practice self-mastery to overcome these limiting beliefs.  This is important, because in life, we get what we believe about our desire, not what we actually desire. Line up your beliefs with what you want.]
- **Step 3.** Act, imagine and feel as if your desire has already manifested and from there, take the next step (take action) towards what you want. You must change on the inside before you can see changes on the outside.
