title: "What to answer to 'mamamatay rin tayong lahat'"
---

This may seem.. morbid. While I do admit that I sometimes say "Mamamatay din tayong lahat" in an escapist manner *(albeit true)*, I do acknowledge that it is true, comforting, and a good way to move forward when it comes to handling problems. However, this acceptance into the finite nature of life also makes one prone to not living ceasing each day.

Embracing [stoicism](moc/stoicism.md) is a good way to avoid that mistake.

All that being said, here are things I like saying in response to ***"Mamamatay rin tayong tayong lahat"***.

## Quotes
- **On committing to live the best life**
	- "When it's over, I want to say: all my life I was a bride married to amazement. I was the bridegroom, taking the world into my arms.When it's over, I don't want to wonder if I have made of my life something particular, and real. I don't want to find myself sighing and frightened, or full of argument. I don't want to end up simply having visited this world." –– [When Death Comes](http://www.phys.unm.edu/~tw/fas/yits/archive/oliver_whendeathcomes.html)
	- "The biggest failure of the human mind is the inability to understand its full function.
- **On enduring suffering**
	- "Life will break you. Nobody can protect you from that, and living alone won't either, for solitude will also break you with its yearning. You have to love. You have to feel. It is the reason you are here on earth. You are here to risk your heart. You are here to be swallowed up. And when it happens that you are broken, or betrayed, or left, or hurt, or death brushes near, let yourself sit by an apple tree and listen to the apples falling all around you in heaps, wasting their sweetness. Tell yourself you tasted as many as you could."
