## Highlights
### How to Become a Better Public Speaker
- When you're public speaking try to speak slower and pause more. Being able to use pauses and own your stage can make your speech a lot more powerful and confident.[^1]
- Whenever I give a speech I never use a script. Instead I create an outline and have bullet points that I want to hit. This makes the speech a lot more engaging and means I avoid going into British Airways mode.[^2]
-  Speeches don't need to be formal. Audiences care most about having fun which means a speech with some banter, humour, and storytelling is going to be a lot more engaging that one without these things.[^3]
