	- “Never attribute to malice or stupidity that which can be explained by moderately rational individuals following incentives in a complex system of interactions.”  
	- Much like its cousin (and name inspiration) Occam’s Razor, Hanlon’s Razor can help us avoid unreasonable assumptions, build stronger relationships, and navigate the world in a more rational way—in the workplace or out of it. 
	- Hanlon’s Razor helps us look at other people’s actions through a more objective lens, and reminds us that people usually aren’t even thinking about us, let alone wickedly cackling as they scheme over evil plans. 
	- In practice
		- “My friend hasn’t been liking my social media posts as much as usual.”
			- Flawed thinking: “I must have done something that made her angry.”
			- Hanlon’s Razor: “Maybe she’s on a digital detox for her mental health.” 
		- “The mechanic didn’t give me as low of a rate as he usually does.”
			- Flawed thinking: “He must be trying to overcharge me, since I told him I don’t know much about cars.” 
			- Hanlon’s Razor: “Maybe he’s trying to value his labor more highly and stop undercharging his clients.” 
		- “My child’s teacher didn’t say hello when I dropped him off today.” 
			- Flawed thinking: “What if she takes her bad mood out on my son?” 
			- Hanlon’s Razor: “Maybe she’s tired, or getting over a cold.” 
		- Casts light on biases
			- [Confirmation bias](notes/sciences/psycho/confirmation-bias.md)
			- [Availability bias](notes/sciences/psycho/availability-bias.md)
			- At work
				- “Jane didn’t show up for our scheduled Zoom meeting.” 
					- Availability bias: “She’s trying to get back at me, because I couldn’t help her with that project last week.”
					- Hanlon’s Razor: “There could be a million reasons she didn’t show—another meeting came up, her notifications aren’t working, or her cat barfed on her iPhone.”
				- “My boss just emailed me asking to set up an urgent one-on-one meeting.”
					- Confirmation bias: “She’s got bad news. This is why I’ve been so anxious that I’ll lose my job.”
					- Hanlon’s Razor: “I have no specific reason to think she’s unhappy with my performance. Maybe she’s been handed a new project she can’t handle, and she needs my help.”
		- How to apply
			- Has this person ever shown bad intentions to me (or anyone else) before?
			- Do they have any actual reason to be angry or upset with me?
			- Am I relating this situation to any of my personal experiences? Do I have a good reason to do so?
			- Could this person’s behavior be explained by stress, forgetfulness, technical issues, or another commonplace reason?
