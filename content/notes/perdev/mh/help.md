## Notes
 - There's nothing wrong with asking for help. The idea of how some people appear successful/ "perfect" may create a barrier for them to becoming vulnerable. This prevents them from asking for help and lets them suffer along in private pain.
 - You cannot help others till you learn how to ask yourself.

	- "If you are ashamed of admitting that you have problems, then you cannot ask for help. If you cannot ask for help, then you cannot receive help. Without receiving real help, you may find it hard to genuinely help other people."
	- "People in the advanced groups are not supposed to have problems. Sadly, this approach keeps many people in a place of quiet suffering. They feel alone in their private pain. This unwillingness to let others in - whether it be from fear, shame, or pain - is what keeps folks in denial and in this zombie-like minds."
