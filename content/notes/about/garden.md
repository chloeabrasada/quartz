title: "On Digital Gardens"

This digital garden is one of my personal projects this year! I'm still learning if there's a *proper* way of setting it up.

I realized how unconducive for permanence my past notes were. I literally have too much bookmark managers + mind dumps *(thanks Apple Notes, Telegram, Messenger, Mem.ai for keeping up with me)*.

## What's a digital garden?
A digital garden is an online space at the intersection of a notebook and a blog, where digital gardeners share seeds of thoughts to be cultivated in public. Contrary to a blog, where articles and essays have a publication date and start decaying as soon as they are published, a digital garden is evergreen: digital gardeners keep on editing and refining their notes.

## Why build a digital garden?
I love how this garden puts it:

So yeah, what motivated me into building my own garden is how much it offered authenticity and how it opens up to new conversations and ideas with different people.
