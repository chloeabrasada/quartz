## Highlights
- [Julie Zhuo on Twitter: "Everyone has an opinion on design. There's always an immediate gut reaction: "Ooh, I love this!" or "Meh." But how do you go beyond that to honing your skills of giving helpful, actionable feedback? Here are the 7 questions I run through when critiquing a product's design ðŸ‘‡" / Twitter](https://twitter.com/joulee/status/1407902488838119431)
	1. What is the user journey to get here?
		1. Who is the user? When do they use this product? Why? How did they arrive here, and what's on their mind? 
	2. What do we want users to feel and achieve here?
		1. What does successful outcome look like?
	3. How important is this page/experience? 
	4. What is our scope/timeline/team?
		1. ==The "best" design differs according to the time/people/money you have.==
	5. For every proposed design change, am I confident it is better that what currently exists?
		1. If no:
			1. cut it
			2. iterate on / improve the design
			3. get more user feedback
			4. A/B test it
	6. What can we remove from this experience and have it work just as well?
	7. If we could throw all our constraints away, would we still design it like this?
