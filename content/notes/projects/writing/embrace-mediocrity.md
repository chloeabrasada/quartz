## Grounding
- **Why?**
	- To break the construct that we should work our ass of in order to achieve societal acceptance
	- To break the social construct that settling is incorrect
	- To impart the concept the it's okay to be mediocre
	- To advocate for prioritizing health over outward sense-seeking
- **How?**
	- Share about current societal standards and how it does more harm than good
	- Expose problem of hustle culture
	- Current rates of mental health conditions in PH, especially in working age (if the statistics of this exists!)
	- Rates of job unsatisfaction
- **Using what?**
	- Facts + empathy-based approach + connecting through an audience perspecitve: "Where else does this fit in a person's daily life?"

- We succumb ourselves to the relentless pressure of society to live our lives in a performative manner–vulnerability is equivalent to weakness, failure is equivalent to, and rest is seen as luxury. We are driven to believe that we should exploit ourselves tirelessly in order to live life with actual meaning. That mental health and self-care are options we should put at the end of the day when we already finished all our deliverables.
- Not being content is the new content.

	- The natural tendency in a capitalist culture is to not be content with the status quo and to keep striving for more, to keep pushing the boundaries. Not being content is the new content. Have you had days where you just lie around and not do anything and not feel guilty at the end of it (or during)? I can’t remember the last time I had such a day. Not a day where I did nothing, of course. But a day where I did nothing and didn’t feel guilty about it.

	- Grind culture can be defined as a promotion of the mentality that if one is not consistently working toward achievement or some larger ambition, they are unmotivated or lack personal pride.
	- Mediocrity, does not denote pursuing mediocrity as the end goal, but in viewing mediocrity as a possible and valid result of one’s effort. This distinction gives a much more flexible approach to managing one’s life.
	- Doing one’s best is no longer a means to an end with that end always being great achievement but is now an end in itself.
