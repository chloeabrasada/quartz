## Notes
- We often think of setting boundaries as limiting between relationships, but we can frame them as needs instead where we establish consensual needs for one another creating more opportunities to foster relationships between two people.
- Discussing boundaries is also vulnerability. It opens for more connection.

## Highlights
- "boundaries as needs, which is rooted in the possibility of them being met, rather than as limitations, we might be more equipped to meet each other more fully and openly at our self-perceived borders. It is at that boundary space where we can begin to acknowledge one another as self sovereign, but also understand that self-sovereignty is only one component of what it means to be a person in the world who is always in relation to other humans and non-humans."
