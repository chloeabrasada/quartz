- We often think that happiness should come when we receive `xyz` or finally get `abc`, but we shouldn't think of happiness/ a good life as something conditional that happens when we reach a certain point. Instead, we can claim it now.

### For reflection
- “At this moment you aren’t on a journey, but wandering about, being driven from place to place, even though what you seek—to live well—is found in all places. Is there any place more full of confusion than the Forum? Yet even there you can live at peace, if needed.” —SENECA, MORAL LETTERS, 28.5b–6a
