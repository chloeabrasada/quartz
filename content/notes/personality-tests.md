## Tests

> My results are [here](https://www.notion.so/cjabrasada/404c60a2c6d245c8b7d3bbd427c0b3d0?v=c107e9203098481fb735ea6c74daa255) lol. ðŸ‘»

1. **Enneagram**
	- I like the enneagram test because there are a looot of resources about working with enneagram styles as well as the performance of each personality depending on their health level.
	- This is also the test that made me fall in love with personality tests lol.

2. **Myerrs-Briggs/ 16 Personalities**
	- This is probably the most popular one which is why there are a lot of resources online! Plus a lot of Facebook groups supporting these.

3. **Four Temperaments**
	- I'm not sure but this might be the oldest? I also think this one reveals the most different aspects of one's personality compared to the other ones.

4. **Tetramap**
	- Good for teams since it's short and the results talk a lot about team dynamics/ how  a person functions with a team.
