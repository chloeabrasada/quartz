# Pre-writing
## How I Want to Write This
- Educate -> Unravel -> Propose a solution
- On the point of serving the people
- Publish research material
## Brainstorming
### Ideas
- What if I told you I can statistically determine how likely you are to fail? Of course, I can’t—but, what if?
	- Socioeconomic status itself can serve as headsign with "I will be around 50% successful in relationship to Elon Musk."
- Success formula
- Statistically programmed to fail
- Questions
	- Are academic institutions inclusive?
	- Where does math fall into class?
	- What issues to mathematics education unveil?
	- Where does math play in capitalism? Fascism? Oppression? Censorahip?
	- Does mathematics gatekeep success?
- What to add
	- Current rates of illiteracy
	- Relationship of SES to success
		- Math -> SES -> Success
- Brain dump
	- Keep the change
	- Anecdote of throwing 10 cents
- It's not a binary opposition--it exists on a spectrum
