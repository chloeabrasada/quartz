## Notes
- **How to build a design team**
	- Work cultures & environments are different–we hire people that would complement the team. The filtering process is important as every member contributes to the overall flow of the team
	- The baseline process involves asking two questions:
		- **How well will this person work with the team culture?**
			- What are our values?
			- How will we be able to grow with `person xyz`?
		- **What skills do we want to see?**
	- It is better to work on this collaboratively, [work-culture](notes/work-culture.md) is created by the people in the workplace, not just defined by the HR dept.
- **Good tooling**

		* Hiring process
			* Phases[^2]
				* **Learn**: Look at every job description you can. Learn from people who’ve built teams (run questions by other leaders). Build an understanding of which skills or traits could be valuable on your team.
				* **Analyze**: Use that understanding to build a comprehensive list of skills. Filter that list down to skills that the company genuinely needs. Filter that down to skills that the Design team should be responsible for. Then to baseline skills that every Designer needs to know.
				* **Evolve**: Have you realized a new gap on your team? Has the company’s or team’s needs changed? What do you need right now? When possible, grow people internally.
			* Steps
				* Create individual list in what they want in team–skills to consider
				* Combine into one masterist
				* Vote & sort
				* Finalize & map
			* Divided into
