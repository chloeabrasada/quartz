	3. Build tension and suspense. You can use one-liners or intense cliffhangers.
	4. You can make writing that severely precise in quick succession.
	5. You can end the sentence with a sudden surprise.

		- Sensory appeal
			- Sitting here now by the open window, a glissando of birdsong on the very lightest of breezes that carries with it the scent of a final incoming summer, I cling to poetry as I cling to life.
			- In one sentence, Myers describes a visual detail (an open window), an auditory detail (a glissando of birdsong), a scent (the scent of a final incoming summer), and a sense of motion or touch (the lightest breeze). These sensory descriptions transport readers, letting them experience the story as if they’re there.
