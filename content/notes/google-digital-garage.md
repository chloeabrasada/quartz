## How websites work
- Server–Computer connected to the internet with a software that allows it to store or host pieces of your website
	- "Serves up right content when requested"
	- Each one has it's own address/ Internet protocol (IP) address
		- String of numbers that stand for a certain part of the internet

### [Domains](notes/domains.md)
- How potential customers will find you
- Type into browser window to go to any site
- www.(domainname).com -> Part that people use to find website
	- Communicating with server -> Send information needed -> So person using can see what they're looking for
	- Browser figures out which server it is located -> Server & browser communicate -> Server sends back information needed

> Server hosts site. Domain name helps people find it.

> To launch a website you need to get what’s called hosting space. Think of it like a plot of land for a house. Sometimes you have to pay a fee. In some cases it’s free. So do shop around before making your choice.
> This ‘plot of land’ is one of many within a server. Think of a server as a street where many companies rent out space for websites. A bit like sharing the same postcode.
> Each server has what’s called an IP, or internet protocol, address. This is made up of a string of numbers that can be located by any device that has internet access.
> Every website has a domain name. This is everything after the www. or World Wide Web part. You can think of this as the physical address of your house.
> But what if someone wants to find you, or in this case your website? They’d use a browser like Google Chrome. This locates and retrieves the website information, and then displays it. How long a website takes to load depends on things such as the amount and type of information, and internet speeds.
