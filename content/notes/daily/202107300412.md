[Mental Illness Isn’t Selfish—You Don’t Fix It with Life Hacks](https://jessicalexicus.medium.com/mental-illness-isnt-selfish-and-you-don-t-cure-it-with-life-hacks-d0955259e233)

- There’s a myth out there about severe mental illness, that you can beat it with a little positive thinking and a few life hacks.
- In fact, I would call this myth toxic. It trivializes the pain and suffering undergone by people with debilitating disorders. It leads to shaming and victim blaming, and I see it all the time.
- The self-help industry has preyed on the sick and poor for decades. They’re running out of tricks. Healthy, intelligent people aren’t buying life hacks anymore. So now the gurus are rebranding themselves. In the midst of a pandemic, we’re in a deep mental health crisis. As we struggle with grief and anxiety, they’re looking for new customers. That’s pretty callous, if you ask me. Someone with a mental illness doesn’t need to be called selfish. They don’t need to be called spoiled or entitled.

- Yes the feeling you get from going from 0 to 1 is amazing. Yes going from 1 to 2 isn’t as great. But ending up at 10 by increasing ever so slightly over 6 months, looking back and realising you’re half way up the mountain — That feels ecstatic.
