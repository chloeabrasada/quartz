## Notes
![yerkes](/photos/yerkes.png)
- Stress is something that we need at optimal amounts. It helps us keep going and improve. However, it is best to keep this at an optimal level wherein you are not compromising yourself.
- There are three levels of arousal as stated: low level (not alert), optimum level, and high level (associated with panic, anxiety, lower concentration). If you're at the low level, you won't really improve. The optimum level is a sweet spot.
