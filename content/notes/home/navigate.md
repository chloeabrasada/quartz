title: "Navigating the Garden"
---

Hello! 👋 Thank you so much for being here! In this page, I map out how this garden is structured for ease of navigation. There are a lot of links & backlinks, so it can get confusing! 😵‍💫

## Structure 🏛
Digital gardens are composed of notes that are interlinked for the purpose of linking thinking. As such, there are notes inside notes.

I structured my garden in this manner from when you navigate from the [homepage.](_index.md) While it does seem linear, all notes are actually interconnected! So you can jump from one note to another and find one note also in another note.

I talk more about the notes system more in [gardening-system.](notes/home/gardening-system.md) Here's a basic outline of what navigating looks like:

> **To update:** Remove points of reference & desk clutter

### Basically... 🎧
- [Home](_index.md) 🏡
	- Entry point towards all the notes. The main points of navigation and entry points are stored there.
- **From the Home** 🗺
	- **Main Maps of Content** 🌞
		- I store these at the home page. I sorted these according to overarching ideas or themes between some notes. They contain general topics that branch to specific topics as you enter.
	- **Projects** 🥰
		- The projects sections contain the projects I publish (more of the thinking processes instead of the final product!).
- **Types of Notes** 🤩
	- From the entry points, I have different types of notes. I talk more about the notes system more in [gardening-system.](notes/home/gardening-system.md) Essentially, here are the types of notes:
		- **Actual Notes** 🫀
			- In these notes, I write in the highlights I read and the thought processes I generated along with them.
		- [Writing](notes/por/personal-learnings.md) ✍️
			- These notes contain solely my writings from personal learnings.
		- [Repository](notes/por/repository.md) 💳
			- These notes contain links and sources for the theme associated with them.
- **Others** 🥳
	- **Related Notes** 🚗
		- The related notes section contains all the notes in which the current note you are in is mentioned. They're all clickable!
	- **Interactive Graph** 📊
		- The interactive graph displays the connections between the different notes. They're all clickable, and you can jump from one note to another from here.

## How-to 🤔

### Using the Page Links 🔗
- The basic way to navigate is to go through the links as connected between the pages.
- I'm still trying to figure out a way to create a distinction between links that point to an outside page and links that are within the website.

### Using the Related Notes/ Backlinks 🛀
- At the bottom of the page is the **Related Notes** section. These contain all the notes in which the **current note is mentioned**. They're all clickable too! 🐭

### Using the Interactive Graph 📈
- The **teal circle** represents where you are within the garden of notes. Hovering to a certain point reveals the connections between the notes, and you can jump from one note to another from here.
