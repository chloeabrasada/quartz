title: "Navigating the Garden"
---

Hello! 👋 Thank you so much for being here! In this page, I map out how this garden is structured for ease of navigation. There are a lot of links & backlinks, so it can get confusing! 😵‍💫

## Structure 🏛
Digital gardens are composed of notes that are interlinked for the purpose of linking thinking. As such, there are notes inside notes.

I structured my garden in this manner from when you navigate from the [homepage.](_index.md) Whilte it does seem linear, all notes are actually interconnected! So you can jump from one note to another and find one note also in another note.

I talk more about the notes system more in [gardening-system.](notes/home/gardening-system.md) Here's a basic outline of what navigating looks like:

### Basically...
- [Home](_index.md) 🏡
	- Entry point towards all the notes. The main points of navigation and entry point are stored there.
- **From the Home ** 🗺
	- **Main Maps of Content** 🌞
		- I store these at the home page. I sorted these according to overarching ideas or themes between some notes. They contain general topics that branch to specific topics as you enter.
	- **Desk Clutter** 🧩
		- The two entry points in the desk clutter ([to-read](moc/to-read.md), [daily-notes](moc/daily-notes.md)) are more of the fleeting notes I take throughout the day. It's mostly just mess and highlights from all over the web.
	- [Points of Reference](moc/por.md) 👈
		- I use the points of reference as keywords to connect the content between different notes. The notes in which each point of reference can be found in the Related Notes section at the bottom.
	- **Projects** 🥰
		- The projects sections contain the projects I publish (more of the thinking processes instead of the final product!).
- **Types of Notes** 🤩
	- From the entrypoints, I have different types of notes. I talk more about the notes system more in [gardening-system](notes/home/gardening-system.md). Essentially, here are the types of notes:
		- **Actual Notes** 🫀
			- In these notes, I write in the highlights I read and the thought processes I generated along with them.
		- [Writing](notes/por/writing.md) ✍️
			- These notes contain solely my writings from personal learnings.
		- [Repository](notes/por/repository.md) 💳
			- These notes contain links and sources for the theme associated with them.
- **Others** 🥳
	- **Related Notes** 🚗
		- The related notes section contains all the notes in which the current note you are in is mentioned. They're all clickable!
	- **Interactive Graph** 📊
		- The interactive graph displays the connections between the different notes. They're all clickable, and you can jump from one note to another from here.

## How-to 🤔

### Using the Page Links 🔗
- The basic way to navigate is to go through the links as connected between the pages.
- I'm still trying to figure out a way to create a distinction between links that point to an outside page and links that are within the website.

### Using the Related Notes/ Backlinks 🛀
- At the bottom of the page is the **Related Notes** section. These contain all the notes in which the **current note is mentioned**. They're all clickable too! 🖱
- This is especially useful for my [points of reference.](moc/por.md)

### Using the Interactive Graph 📈
- The **teal circle** represents where you are in within the garden of notes. Hovering to a certain point reveals the connections between the notes, and you can jump from one note to another from here.
