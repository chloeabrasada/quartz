> I have super scrappy baseline knowledge in code. I only reached up to midway of my FreeCodeCamp journey so I'm documenting my journey here at [Building this website](notes/home/building-this-website.md)

## Currently...
- Fixing the broken links
- Fixing the notes tagged [in-progress](notes/por/in-progress.md) *(also will I ever lol)*
- Concretizing my system üçÉ
- Revisiting my old notes in Notion, Notes, Mem, Telegram, Messenger, Discord, etc. I really wish I learned about Obsidian earlier grr.

**One of many note repositories lol**

- [ ] Transfer material from Commonplace notebook

## Trying to figure out...
