## Business strategy
### Knowing who you are
> Customers can't identify your value if you can't
- What drives you?
	- Better product? Passion? Hobby? Wealth? Independence?
- When asked "what makes you the better option?", don't answer with service, quality, innovation, my experience, my education -> All of these are form the company

How to reframe

| Factor        | Reframing                        |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Service       | How do you embody or deliver?    |
| Quality       | What makes it better?            |
| Innovation    | What is the value?               |
| My experience | How does that help the customer? |
| My education  | How does this help the customer? |

> Focus on your customer. Customers want value for their money. ==What's in it for me?==

- Your product value
	- Monetary? Functional? Tangible?

Ask yourself:

| ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| How does this statement change your approach?              | What does this purpose statement mean to you?                   | How can you measure your marketing according to this statement? |
