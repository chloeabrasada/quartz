- **Relevant Notes**


## Notes
- We often glorify complex and hard-to-understand articles. However, this idea that the "climb should be hard" is not progress, we are instead putting on research debt.
- Research debt can come in the form of poor exposition, undigested ideas, bad abstractations and notation, and noise.
- When faced with these, people have to exert interpretative labor which varies depending on the material presented.
- [We must move forward into research distillation](notes/research-distillation.md). While many people want to do this, there are barriers such as: perverse incentive, don't enjoy distillation, [there is lack of support in research](notes/lack-of-support-in-research.md).

## Highlights
[Research Debt](https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/)[^1]
- The climb isn’t progress: the climb is a mountain of debt.
- Research can also have debt.
	- Poor Exposition
	- Undigested Ideas 
	- Bad abstractions and notation - Unfortunately, we often get stuck with the first formalisms to develop even when they’re bad. 
	- Noise 
- Interpretaive Labor
- There’s a tradeoff between the energy put into explaining an idea, and the energy needed to understand it. 
- On the other extreme, the explainer can do the absolute minimum and abandon their audience to struggle. This energy is called interpretive labor.
- In these one-to-many cases, each member of the audience pays the cost of understanding, even though the cost of explaining stays the same. 3 As a result, the cost of understanding has a multiplier in the interpretive labor tradeoff — sometimes a huge multiplier. 4
- Just like before, the cost of explaining stays constant as the group grows, but the cost of understanding increases with each new member.
- Young ideas aren’t ending points for us to put in a paper and abandon. When we let things stop there the debt piles up. It becomes harder to understand and build on each other’s work and the field fragments.
- It’s a lack of digesting ideas – or, at least, a lack of the public version of ideas being digested. 
- Research distillation
- Research distillation is the opposite of research debt. It can be incredibly satisfying, combining deep scientific understanding, empathy, and design to do justice to our research and lay bare beautiful insights.
- Distillation is also hard. It’s tempting to think of explaining an idea as just putting a layer of polish on it, but good explanations often involve transforming the idea.
- This leaves us with no easy way out. We can’t solve research debt by having one person write a textbook: their energy is spread too thin to polish every idea from scratch. We can’t outsource distillation to less skilled non-experts: refining and explaining ideas requires creativity and deep understanding, just as much as novel research.
- Where are the distillers?
	- Perverse incentives, like wanting your work to look difficult. Those certainly exist, but we don’t think they’re the main factor. 6 Another possibility is that they don’t enjoy research distillation. Again, we don’t think that’s what’s going on.
	- We don’t support them. 7
	- An aspiring research distiller lacks many things that are easy to take for granted: a career path, places to learn, examples and role models. Underlying this is a deeper issue: their work isn’t seen as a real research contribution. We need to fix this.
