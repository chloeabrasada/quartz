## Notes

## Highlights
- “In the most basic sense, a system is any group of interacting, interrelated, or interdependent parts that form a complex and unified whole that has a specific purpose.”
- Ironically, our brain hates thinking since it needs energy that can be utilized elsewhere. By creating systems, we make this process easier and faster.
