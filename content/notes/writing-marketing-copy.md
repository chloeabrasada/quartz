### Headlines
1. Be direct–the clearer what the write-up is about, the better!
2. Avoid [fearmongering](notes/fearmongering.md)
3. Use formulas!
	- `product name`: The answer to `blank`
	- `number` ways that `product name` `does something cool`
	- Now you can have `blank`
	- Don't compromise on `blank`
	- What everyone is saying about `blank
	- How to `blank`
	- You'll save `blank`
	- After `blank`, you'll never see `blank` the same way
