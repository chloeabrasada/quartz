## Notes
- Believing what's convenient
- Believing what we connect most to ourself

## Highlights
- Availability bias is the tendency to rely on information that’s readily available, instead of what’s actually more relevant to the situation. In the context of workplace relationships, this often leads us to connect other people’s behavior to ourselves, because those are the experiences that are already occupying our mental space.[^1]
