## Notes
### Considerations
1. Font legibility
	- Ultra thin fonts are difficult to read especially as paragraph
	- Uneven weight distribution
2. Text alignment
	- Uneven rag in typography, example in centered text
3. Alt caps
	- All caps has more cognitive load
	- Consider use when text is too long
4. Underlines
	- Standard: It is a hyperlink
	- Consider something else for emphasis
5. Contrast
	- Use contrast checkers
	- >> Higher contrast
6. Line length
	- Make it hold within a container
	- Set to a specific amount using ch
7. Line height
	- 1.6
8. Links
	- Use more concrete actionable
	- Word immediately says the action instead of the "here"
9. Navigation
	- Test for interaction & design
