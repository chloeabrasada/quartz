title: "Design is political x Decolonizing design"

## Notes
- Western ideologies have shaped our concepts of "preferable design" In subjecting ourselves
	- Anything outside these Western preferences are seen as different
- We should remove the distinction of art and craft
	- The concept of a difference between art and craft reflect classist distinctions from the West
