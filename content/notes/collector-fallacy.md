## Notes
- Fallacy: As you collect, your knowledge grows
- But what actually happens is that you don't process and digest these notes
- Although a lengthy process, take time to convert these notes into ones you actually learn, know, and digest--you don't learn just by highlighting
- What we need to focus on is DEVELOP knowledge, not connect

## Highlights
- [The Collector’s Fallacy • Zettelkasten Method](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/?cmdid=N2TB21WOUDQWD2)
	- The worst we could do is to pile up copies until the stack grows intimidatingly high, until it becomes unmanageable.
	- Reading alone won’t suffice: we have to create notes, too, to create real, sustainable knowledge.

	- Collecting a new idea does not equal KNOWING a new idea, or being able to work with it.
	- We don’t need more knowledge every second. Instead, we need to get better at developing the knowledge we already have.
