- **Relevant Notes**

## Notes
- Practice vulnerability in your approach.
- Stay authentic.

## Highlights
### Concepts
- We become closer with people when we’re vulnerable.[^1][^2]
- It’s easy for us to think that we’re too selfish, but in fact, most of us aren’t anywhere near selfish enough. We’re not used to putting our own needs, wants, desires centre stage because we’re ‘good’ people.[^1][^2]

### Cases
-  Instead of asking “what do you do?“, a more standard question when meeting someone should be “In what ways are you weird?” or “what’s broken about you?”
