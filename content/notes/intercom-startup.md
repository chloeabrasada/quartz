## Key takeaways
- The first thing in marketing a startup is thinking about it from the inside out–start with product then move to product messaging.
- Process view
	1. Determine core audience & strategies.
		- Think of the customer first. Select strategies that would appeal to them. (see: [customer-research](notes/customer-research))
	2. Find [product marketing fit](notes/product-marketing-fit).
- Creating the strategy
	- Messaging
		- In creating the message, [start with why](notes/perdev/life-advice/start-with-why)]
		- [Word of mouth](notes/word-of-mouth.md) is powerful, which is why it is important to have a uniform messaging of what the product is through alignment. Use it wisely in a manner that is simple, compelling, specific, differentiated, and defensible. 
- Working with teams
	- Be aligned with the whole team.
	- Set realistic expectations of the team.
- Notes
	- You need to constantly change and adjust your marketing channels. *"Channels become saturated, copycats will emerge, etc."*
	- The general [goal in marketing](notes/marketing-goals.md) is customers ==1.) find the product, 2.) understand it, and 3.) be convience they need it.== #important 

## Extracted highlights
### Marketng in year one
#### Choosing a tactic for your addressable market (see: [customer-research](notes/customer-research))
- Start by understanding the behaviors of the people you’re trying to reach, and then choose a particular marketing tactic based on those exhibited behaviors
	- If you’re selling a cool new piece of technology to developers, like Twilio, community focused activities such as meetups are going to work better than paid ads.
#### Finding product marketing fit
I didn’t send one size fits all emails asking people to give us their credit card details. I’d always remind the recipient of how we met and explain why I was emailing them, and then I’d mock up a screenshot of how Intercom would look if they started using it and tailor the message to their use case.
You need to constantly be working on marketing tactics that are actually getting people to buy your product.
### [Start with why](notes/perdev/life-advice/start-with-why)]
- No matter how good your product is, if you can’t tell a cohesive, compelling story about it, you’re going to have a very hard time getting people’s attention when you actually do take it to market. 
- Why
	- Marketing, at the end of the day, is not just about a company’s mission. It’s about understanding why a customer would care about that mission, and translating that understanding into a story
- How
	- People don’t care about you, people care about themselves and their problems.
	- Have clear understanding of customer and [understand problem you can solve for them](understand-problem-of-customers) (see: [customer-journey](notes/customer-journey))
- What
	- Once you’ve sold someone on your story and shown them how your product can solve their problem, you should back it up with hard claims about how effective your product will be in solving their problem to accelerate their decision making.
	- How to frame your what
		- Justification: Why you?
		- Differentation: What makes you different?
### Marketing at a product first company
- Marketing should be invoved at every stage of the funnel.
- I started with Intercom’s homepage.
	- The majority of people who visit your marketing site don’t have the time to invest in learning what it is you actually do. If you can’t communicate that clearly on your homepage they’ll just bounce, quite literally, off your site – an opportunity gone.
- The next most important step is amplifying the things your product team is building.

### Getting word of mouth for your startup
- Great messaging is simple, compelling, specific, differentiated and defensible.
	- Simple. It’s easily understood by current and prospective customers.
	- Compelling. It describes something that is interesting or desirable to them.
	- Specific. It captures what your product does, not an overly abstract statement of it.
	- Differentiated. It includes something that makes it unique among peers.
	- Defensible. It shouldn’t be easy for your competitor to adopt/copy your messaging.
### Content, then marketing
[content-marketing](notes/content-marketing.md)
- Here are five principles we hold dear regarding content.
	1. Content, then marketing
	2. Grow with editorial principles
	3. Be brand relevant
	4. Have an opinion
	5. But never lose sight of the goa
