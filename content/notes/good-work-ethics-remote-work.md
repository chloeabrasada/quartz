## Notes
1. Set meetings only with agendas. Communicate: What the meeting is about & what a person's role would be in the meeting. (related to: [How to facilitate effective meetings](notes/skills/hr/how-to-facilitate-effective-meetings.md))
2. Don't presume people are always available.
3. Set the conversation consistently.
4. Turn on your camera.
