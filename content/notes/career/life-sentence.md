## Notes

## Highlights
- "We must not get so wrapped up in our work that we think we’re immune from the reality of aging and life. Who wants to be the person who can never let go? Is there so little meaning in your life that your only pursuit is work until you’re eventually carted off in a coffin? Take pride in your work. But it is not all." [The Daily Stoic](notes/sources/books/the-daily-stoic.md)
