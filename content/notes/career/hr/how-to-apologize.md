- **Apologizing to a colleague**
	- Make it personal: Private > public

	- **Formula**
		1. Admit the mistake
		2. Connect with emotion
		3. Offer a solution

## Highlights

	- “I note that the event took place in front of other people, but I think the person who messed up should first offer a private apology because an apology should focus on the needs of the aggrieved person, and that person might not want a public apology.
	- “What wrongdoers must avoid is doing things that merely look like they are trying to make themselves look better.”
	- Steps
		- The first is “an admission of guilt, something like: ‘I stuffed up. I found out that I falsely accused you in front of our colleagues...’”
		- The second is “an expression of emotion: ‘I am sorry because I realise this must have hurt and embarrassed you…’”
		- And the third is “an offer of repair: ‘What can I do to make you feel better?’ A suggestion here is to offer a public apology in front of the people who observed the original event, but only if the aggrieved person wants that.”
