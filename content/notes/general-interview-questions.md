## Questions
General Sources[^2] [^3] [^1] [^4]
### General, Informational
1. Tell me about yourself.
	- Approach A [^3]
		- Start by describing your <u>background with a summary of your most impressive responsibilities</u>
			- *"I've been a hostess at XYZ Restaurant for just over two years where I greet and seat customers, assess wait times, fulfill to-go orders and answer the phones. I love the lively and busy environment—we often have Friday and Saturday wait times of one hour or more...”*
		- Next, briefly summarize your previous experience with <u>key achievements</u>
			- **"...Before working at XYZ Restaurant, I worked in retail as a floor associate for five years. Working in retail developed the customer service skills that make me a great hostess, offering a top-tier dining experience from the moment customers walk in the door. It also equipped me with the ability to work quickly under pressure..."*
		- Lastly, express how you found the new job and why it's a good fit for you and your goals
			- *"...I've enjoyed and grown in my current role, but wish to expand and utilize my customer service expertise in an elite restaurant environment. I am interested in your restaurant because of its reputation for delivering first in class service to your patrons in a lively, dynamic environment.”*
	- Approach B
		- FORD Method
			- Family
			- Occupation
			- Recreation
			- Dream
2. Why do you want to work here? [^5] [^6]
	- Don't answer something that's selfish. Think of it as <u>“Why would this company want to hire me?”</u>
	- Ask yourself:
	- <u>How can you help the company succeed?</u>
		- Read up on what’s happening with the company and its industry. Has it recently changed its product or service offerings? What competitive pressures is it facing? Consider this landscape and think, “What knowledge and experience do I have that would be especially useful to this employer right now?”
    - <u>What past career successes could you potentially repeat at this company?</u>
		- In previous jobs, how did you meet or exceed your employers’ expectations? What problems did you play a major role in solving? What ideas did you introduce that helped the company save money or otherwise boost its bottom line? What lessons have you learned that you could apply in the future to create value for the potential employer?
	- <u>How will you complement the company’s culture?</u>
		- A candidate’s ability to fit within the organizational culture is an important hiring factor for many employers. So, do your homework on the company’s culture and **identify what you find most appealing about it.** For instance, if the firm encourages entrepreneurial thinking and that’s important to you, include that in your response.
    - Examples
        - *“I see this opportunity as a way to contribute to an exciting/forward-thinking/fast-moving company/industry, and I feel I can do so by/with my … ”*
        - *“I feel my skills are particularly well-suited to this position because … ”*
        - *“I believe I have the type of knowledge to succeed in this role and at the company because … ”*
        - *“I’m excited about this job opportunity, as it would allow me to … ”*
3. Why should we hire you?
	- **EXPERIENCE** Show that you have <u>skills and experience</u> to do the job and deliver great results.
	- **WORK CULTURE** Highlight that <u>you’ll fit in and be a great addition</u> to the team.
	- **IMPACT** Describe how hiring you will make their life easier and help them achieve more.
	- **CAPABILITY** Show enthusiasm for performing required duties, not just capability.
	- *Sample:* Oh wow, where do I begin! I have been an avid traveler since as young as I can remember. When I reached adulthood and started booking flights for myself, your airline would be my top choice. Alpha Airlines has always made long-distance travel a pleasure, and I would be honored to say that I work for you. On top of this, I believe that my patience and multitasking skills are second to none, and these would go a long way in helping me the best flight attendant possible.
	- *What not to answer:* Money, perks, skills, desperation, general interest
4. What can you bring to the company?
5. Can you explain why your background and experience would be a good fit for this job?
	- *Sample:* I certainly can! Well, from what I’ve read on your company’s roadmap plans posted online, it sounds like you need a project manager who is capable of handling other departmental roles, as well. I couldn’t find a way to succinctly describe it on my resume, but during my internship at BioGenCo, I spent a month each on five different teams to get a handle on how the company functions as a whole. Now, with my supervisory experience where I’ve raised output by 32%, I believe I am well equipped to be the best project manager, while also being knowledgeable of the roles of other departments.

## Others
- **How to answer interview questions you don't know the answer to**[^11]
	1. **Take your time**
	2. **Think aloud**
		- "Add transitional adverbs like “first,” “then,” and “lastly” to give your answer some structure. You can also finish off with a qualifying statement that “the process varies depending on the situation,” which shows that you’re flexible even if your answer isn’t what the hiring manager would do."
	3. **Redirect**
		- "If you simply don’t have it, try redirecting the answer to something you do have experience with."
	4. **Have a fail-safe**
		- "Be prepared with a fail-safe answer that focuses on your enthusiasm for the position and knowledge of the industry. Something like, “That’s not a concept I’m really familiar with yet, but finance is something I’m really excited about, and I’ve been actively trying to learn more. I’ve been keeping up with deals and have read about a few that your company has been involved in. I’ve also learned a lot about the industries that you advise. I think the consolidation that’s going on in the auto industry is going to create a lot of interesting opportunities going forward, and it’ll be an opportunity to learn a great deal about the M&A business.”
