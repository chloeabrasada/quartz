## [Fellowship – Open Principles](Fellowship%20–%20Open%20Principles)

## Notes
### Recap
- [[Generic principles]] - Be open-minded
- [mental-models](notes/mental-models.md)
- [[Situational principles]]
- [[Life values or virtues]]
- [biases](notes/biases.md)
- [[Habits]]
- Methods/ best practices
### Private principles
- **Why private principles?**
	- Personal heuristics
		- Not really principles
		- More on implicit experience
		- May be biased, but good to have them written somewhere and then ==make it more generalized== to make it more actionable
	- Principles that are not mature
		- We want to develop them more
	- Personal biases
	- Principles too specific to your world view
### Steps to learn principles
- Be aware: resolve unknowns, about breadth
- Understand: correctly and deeply
- Believe: personal fit, trusted source, from people you know
- Create: design your principle well so it suits you
- Strategize: plan & predict your learning of principles
- Remember: remember your principles when you need them
- Act: map principles to actions correctly and effectively
- Measure: noticing the results of actions, avoid bias
- Iterate: update principles to fit ourselves
### Steps
#### Create
- Types: Habits, situational, bias
- **Bottom up approach** (learn from about your action)
	- [[brain dump]] about your observation/ reflection
	- conclude & find patterns
	- generalize the patterns which becomes a principle
- **Top down approach** (think from your goals)
	- List your goals and flaws
	- Think about situations you like to improve
	- Find/ brainstorm for principles for the situations that work with your flaws and help you reach your goals
- More ways
	- Doing thinking exercise

	- Personality tests
		- Understand your biases/ how you think
