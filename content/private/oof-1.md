### What are principles?
General rules
#### Types of principles
1. Generic principles
	- Generic principles
	- Some say that there are no generic principles
2. Mental models
	- Perspective to the world
	- Ex. [[Opportunity costs]]
		- Can be applied into many aspects of our life
3. Situational principles
	- A rule at a specific scenario
4. Life values or virtues
	- Just words/ very short
	- How you see the worlds
5. Biases
	- May be very personal
6. Habits
	- Small rules or specific habits
7. Methods/ Best practices

> They can influence each other

### Becoming principles
- To be principled is to act according to your goals and values/ how you can be coherent/ aligned with who you want to be
	- Ways you can measure this
		1. Aligned between principles and self (goals, values, personalities)
		2. Aligned between principles and actions

#### Steps to learn principles
1. Be aware
	- Resolve unknowns, about breadth
2. Understand
	- Correctly and deeply
3. Believe
	- Make sure you believe it is useful for you
	- Try to learn from other people
4. Remember
	- Have it in your hat
	- Hard to build up because we need to build-up
5. Plan and forecast
	- When you are learning a principle, it is different to apply it at a situation. Planning in BETWEEN is a completely different thing also.
	- The idea to forecast is different also
6. Apply
	- Think how you can convert something generic into action
7. Track feedback
8. Iterate

### Why become "principled"?
 - ==Our brain is not evolved to be principled==
	 - Brain is shortsighted *(we want short-term pleasure than long-term)*, emotional *(reactive to environment)*, experience-driven *(we tend to do things we are used to doing)*, not enough computation, geared for energy-optimization *(we optimize for decisions that take the lessest energy)*; memory is biased
 - Help you have full perspectives and think in advance
 - Help overcome our emotions
 - Help you grow faster, and maker better decisions
