I&amp;rsquo;m Chloe Abrasada. I actually have a second name that I don&amp;rsquo;t use for branding purposes (jkjk). I&amp;rsquo;m a productivity nerd 👩‍🏫, web lurker 💻, and design enthusiast 🎨.

In this page, I map out how this garden is structured for ease of navigation. There are a lot of links &amp;amp; backlinks, so it can get confusing! 😵‍💫
Structure 🏛 Digital gardens are composed of notes that are interlinked for the purpose of linking thinking. As such, there are notes inside notes.
I structured my garden in this manner from when you navigate from the homepage.</description></item><item><title>On Digital Gardens</title><link>https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/home/garden/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/home/garden/</guid><description>This digital garden is one of my personal projects this year! I&amp;rsquo;m still learning if there&amp;rsquo;s a proper way of setting it up.
I realized how unconducive for permanence my past notes were. I literally have too much bookmark managers + mind dumps (thanks Apple Notes, Telegram, Messenger, Mem.ai for keeping up with me).
This digital garden serves as my personal knowledge management system. I&amp;rsquo;m a really forgetful person who tends to highlight stuff and tbh rarely comes back to them!</description></item><item><title>Roadmap</title><link>https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/home/roadmap/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/home/roadmap/</guid><description>I have super scrappy baseline knowledge in code. I only reached up to midway of my FreeCodeCamp journey so I&amp;rsquo;m.. lost&amp;hellip;. and reliant on Google search lol. I&amp;rsquo;m documenting my journey here at Building this website. Currently&amp;hellip; Fixing the broken links Fixing the notes tagged #in-progress/garden (also will I ever lol) Concretizing my system 🍃 Revisiting my old notes in Notion, Notes, Mem, Telegram, Messenger, Discord, etc. I really wish I learned about Obsidian earlier grr.</description></item></channel></rss>
